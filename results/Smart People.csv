10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2025.102252,GeoAvatar: A big mobile phone positioning data-driven method for individualized pseudo personal mobility data generation,Li P.,"The importance of personal mobility data is widely recognized in various fields. However, the utilization of real personal mobility data raises privacy concerns. Therefore, it is crucial to generate pseudo personal mobility data that accurately reflects real-world mobility patterns while safeguarding user privacy. Nevertheless, existing methods for generating pseudo mobility data, mostly focusing on trip or trajectory generation, have limitations in capturing sufficient individual heterogeneity. To address these gaps, taking pseudo-person(avatar) as ground-zero, a novel individual-based human mobility generator named GeoAvatar has been proposed – which considering individual heterogeneity in spatial and temporal decision-making, incorporates demographic characteristics.","Our method utilizes a deep generative model to generate heterogeneous individual life patterns, a variation inference model for inferring individual demographic characteristics, and a Bayesian-based approach for generating spatial choices considering individual demographic characteristics. Through our method, we have achieved generating realistic pseudo personal human mobility data - we evaluated the proposed method based on physical features – obeying common law of human mobility, activity features – showing diverse and realistic activities, and spatial-temporal characteristics – presenting high-accuracy in terms of temporal grid population and od-count, demonstrating its good performance, with both a big mobile phone GPS trajectory dataset from Tokyo Metropolis and a big mobile phone CDR dataset from Shanghai. Furthermore, this method maintains extensibility for broader applications, making it a promising framework for generating pseudo personal human mobility data."

By integrating social media text and image data, mobile signaling data, and multisource geographic data, this research identifies key perceptual factors affecting coastal spaces' popularity. The findings highlight that visual and auditory perceptions, aesthetic services, and amenity services are vital for visitor satisfaction, while biodiversity and cultural services significantly impact visitation frequency.

10.1007/s42001-024-00332-0,A comprehensive investigation of variational auto-encoders for population synthesis,Sané A.R.,"The use of synthetic populations has grown considerably over the recent years, in revolutionizing studies conducted within various fields, including social science research, urban planning, public health and transportation modeling. These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners.","This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals. In conclusion, despite a number of limitations, VAE constitutes a very promising methodology for generating synthetic populations, in offering practitioners numerous advantages. This paper is accompanied by a Python notebook to assist interested readers implement this new methodology."
10.7544/issn1000-1239.202330718,Person Re-identification Method Based on Hybrid Real-Synthetic Data,Qi L.,"In recent years, the rapid urbanization and development of the social economy have led to a growing focus on public safety issues. Governments across the world are increasingly promoting the construction of smart cities and intelligent security systems to safeguard the lives and property of citizens and maintain social stability. Person re-identification (ReID) is an essential technology for building smart cities, with significant implications for security monitoring and criminal investigation applications. The goal of person re-identification is to accurately identify specific individuals captured under different cameras. However, due to intra-class differences resulting from various factors such as illumination, viewpoint, occlusion, and pose, person re-identification remains a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Although existing fully supervised person re-identification methods have made significant progress, the scarcity of data and labels poses a bottleneck for further improving model performance.","To address this challenge, we introduce a more complex and diverse synthetic dataset with easy-to-obtain labels for auxiliary training, and propose a novel camera-aware asymmetric adversarial learning (CAAL) method that overcomes intra-class variation among multiple cameras and the domain-shift between real data and synthetic data, enabling the learning of camera-invariant feature representations from diverse data sources. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of misleading information carried by synthetic datasets and prevent the model from overfitting to synthetic data during adversarial training, we propose using an auxiliary network trained on real-world data to constrain the training of the backbone network. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Despite the diverse means for data collection in current times, the real-world trajectory data in practical application remains severely limited due to concerns over personal privacy.","In this study, we designed a Spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced multi-TAsk GEnerative adversarial network (GAN), named STAGE, to generate synthetic trajectories that statistically resemble the real data without recycling personal information. In STAGE, we designed a multi-task generator with three stages of spatio-temporal generation tasks, i.e. activity-sequence generation task, township-level trajectory generation task, and neighborhood-level trajectory generation task, with the last one as the main task while the other two as auxiliary tasks. Meanwhile, we designed a spatial consistency loss in the adversarial training process to assess the spatial consistency of generated trajectories at different spatial scales. Experiment results show that compared to the baselines, trajectories generated by our method have closer data distributions to the real ones. We argued that the designs of spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced generation tasks and training loss benefit the spatiotemporal generation processes, which help reproduce the temporal patterns of human daily activities and spatial distribution of human movements."

10.1007/978-3-031-82633-7_27,EEG Biometrics with GAN Integration for Secure Smart City Data Access,Saia R.,"Biometric systems leveraging ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) data for user authentication present significant potential in diverse contexts, especially in Smart City ecosystems where secure access to sensitive data is crucial (e.g., healthcare systems, intelligent transportation, smart grids, public safety, and citizen services). However, the complexity and variability of EEG data raise challenges in developing effective solutions.","In this context, after a preliminary series of experiments used to find the best feature extraction method for the input, and performed by exploiting the Biometric EEG Dataset (BED), this paper proposes a novel EEG-based user verification framework. It utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction, followed by feature selection via the Boruta strategy and automated data quantization. An important aspect of this approach is the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic EEG data, which, along with real data, is employed to train an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The ensemble decision is made using soft voting mechanisms, promising a robust and competitive solution compared to current state-of-the-art techniques. Initial experiments suggest that this framework has significant potential for further development and optimization."
10.3390/land13122178,Integrating Spatiotemporal and Travel-Related Information for Accurate Urban Passenger Profiling Using GANs,Duan X.,"The elaborate description of passenger travel profiles is of significant importance in urban planning, socioeconomic structural design, and individual travel preference analysis. Traditional models often lack consideration of personalized features and exhibit suboptimal performance in constructing spatiotemporal dependencies.","To address these issues, this paper proposes a method that integrates spatiotemporal information with travel-related information and employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) for adversarial training. This method accurately fits the true distribution of user travel data, thereby providing detailed profiles of public transportation passengers’ travel behavior. Specifically, the proposed approach considers the complete travel chain of individuals, establishes a spatiotemporal constraint representation model, and utilizes GANs to simulate the distribution of passenger travel, obtaining more compact and high-level travel vector features. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately captures passengers’ travel patterns in both the temporal and spatial dimensions, offering technical support for urban transportation planning."
10.1145/3678717.3691311,MobGLM: A Large Language Model for Synthetic Human Mobility Generation,Zhang K.,"Human mobility generation plays a critical role in urban transportation planning. Existing human mobility generation models often fall short of understanding travelers’ demographics and integrating multimodal information, including activity purposes, destination choices and transport mode preferences. Recently, mobility generation models leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention, while they are limited in directly reproducing spatial information in human mobility profiles.","To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Mobility Generative Language Model (MobGLM), a novel approach for generating synthetic human mobility data to support urban planning, transport management, energy consumption and epidemic control. MobGLM addresses these limitations by capturing the complex relationships between agents’ mobility patterns and individual demographics. By incorporating personal information, activity types, locations and traffic modes as encoders, MobGLM uniquely identifies and replicates features of human mobility. Our framework is evaluated using a large, real-world mobility dataset and benchmarked against state-of-the-art personal mobility generation techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of MobGLM in producing accurate and reliable synthetic mobility data, highlighting its potential applications in various urban mobility contexts."

10.1145/3637528.3671866,ControlTraj: Controllable Trajectory Generation with Topology-Constrained Diffusion Model,Zhu Y.,"Generating trajectory data is among promising solutions to addressing privacy concerns, collection costs, and proprietary restrictions usually associated with human mobility analyses. However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability.","To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts."
10.1145/3640794.3665562,Improving Conversational User Interfaces for Citizen Complaint Management through enhanced Contextual Feedback,Karren K.,"As cities transform, disrupting citizens' lives, their participation in urban development is often undervalued despite its importance. Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes.","The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources. The results show that contextual feedback performed better overall, with significant improvements in the pragmatic and hedonic quality, attractiveness, reuse intention, feeling that the complaint is taken seriously, and the citizens' trust in their municipality."
10.1609/aaai.v38i1.27802,Social Physics Informed Diffusion Model for Crowd Simulation,Chen H.,"Crowd simulation holds crucial applications in various domains, such as urban planning, architectural design, and traffic arrangement. In recent years, physics-informed machine learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in crowd simulation but fail to model the heterogeneity and multi-modality of human movement comprehensively.","In this paper, we propose a social physics-informed diffusion model named SPDiff to mitigate the above gap. SPDiff takes both the interactive and historical information of crowds in the current timeframe to reverse the diffusion process, thereby generating the distribution of pedestrian movement in the subsequent timeframe. Inspired by the well-known social physics model, i.e., Social Force, regarding crowd dynamics, we design a crowd interaction module to guide the denoising process and further enhance this module with the equivariant properties of crowd interactions. To mitigate error accumulation in long-term simulations, we propose a multi-frame rollout training algorithm for diffusion modeling. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPDiff in terms of macroscopic and microscopic evaluation metrics. Code and appendix are available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SPDiff."
10.5753/jisa.2024.3887,Towards a Framework to Evaluate Generative Time Series Models for Mobility Data Features,Ribeiro I.F.,"Understanding human mobility has implications for several areas, such as immigration, disease control, mobile networks performance, and urban planning. However, gathering and disseminating mobility data face challenges such as data collection, handling of missing information, and privacy protection. An alternative to tackle these problems consists of modeling raw data to generate synthetic data, preserving its characteristics while maintaining its privacy.","Thus, we propose MobDeep, a unified framework to compare and evaluate generative models of time series based on mobility data features, which considers statistical and deep learning-based modeling. To achieve its goal, MobDeep receives as input statistical or Generative Adversarial Network-based models (GANs) and the raw mobility data, and outputs synthetic data and the metrics comparing the synthetic with the original data. In such way, MobDeep allows evaluating synthetic datasets through qualitative and quantitative metrics. As a proof-of-concept, MobDeep implements one classical statistical model (ARIMA) and three GANs models. To demonstrate MobDeep on distinct mobility scenarios, we considered an open dataset containing information about bicycle rentals in US cities and a private dataset containing information about a Brazilian metropolis’s urban traffic. MobDeep allows observing how each model performs in specific scenarios, depending on the characteristics of the mobility data. Therefore, by using MobDeep researchers can evaluate their resulting models, improving the fidelity of the synthetic data regarding the original dataset."

In the presence of closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) in smart cities, there is an emerging challenge in apprehending criminals, leading to a need for innovative solutions.","In this paper, the propose a model aimed at enhancing real-time emergency response capabilities and swiftly identifying criminals. This initiative aims to foster a safer environment and better manage criminal activity within smart cities. The proposed architecture combines an image-to-image stable diffusion model with violence detection and pose estimation approaches. The diffusion model generates synthetic data while the object detection approach uses YOLO v7 to identify violent objects like baseball bats, knives, and pistols, complemented by MediaPipe for action detection. Further, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network classifies the action attacks involving violent objects. Subsequently, an ensemble consisting of an edge device and the entire proposed model is deployed onto the edge device for real-time data testing using a dash camera. Thus, this study can handle violent attacks and send alerts in emergencies. As a result, our proposed YOLO model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 89.5% for violent attack detection, and the LSTM classifier model achieves an accuracy of 88.33% for violent action classification. The results highlight the model’s enhanced capability to accurately detect violent objects, particularly in effectively identifying violence through the implemented artificial intelligence system."

Inspired by their natural language processing and pattern recognition functionalities, we attempted to utilize LLMs to simulate the activity patterns of people of different ages and occupations in metropolitan areas (Tokyo). By leveraging pre-processed Person Trip data, we employed 3 methods to test the ability of LLMs to generate urban daily activity data. The results were evaluated based on metrics such as rationality, diversity, and error rates. Results indicate that the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model is capable of accurately simulating the activity distribution patterns of metropolitan populations. Among the prompt-based strategies, the few-shot approach yielded the best performance. Although designing the instruction for prompts and post-processing the data required considerable time, the few-shot prompt strategy proved to be an effective option for this task.","Urban daily activity patterns play an important role in fields such as urban planning and traffic management, while the powerful data generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) have sparked a surge of interest in recent years, with applications in various domains.

The DT platform integrates a diverse range of historical and real-time data, providing a comprehensive view of urban mobility conditions. Descriptive statistics are employed to identify patterns in parking occupancy and violation frequencies, while Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms enhance predictive and generative analytics for forecasting parking needs and simulating scenarios with other mobility aspects. Advanced analytics uncover hidden patterns and behaviors, and visualization tools map data onto the urban layout to facilitate spatial planning and resource allocation. Scenario simulation enables urban planners to assess the impact of different strategies in a virtual environment prior to real-world implementation.

10.1007/978-981-97-3682-9_72,Novel Attention-Based Framework for Person Re-identification in Video Surveillance,Cui L.,"Intelligent video surveillance systems, automatic entry and retail systems at theme parks, airport passenger flow control, and automated driving behavior analysis are a few applications where critical insights can be generated by detecting and identifying people through a camera network. In different public locations, such as train stations, airports, hospitals, shopping centers, etc., widespread camera networks are used daily, covering vast areas and having non-overlapping perspectives and providing a tremendous amount of relevant data. We cannot rely on manual monitoring to use this data efficiently for public safety applications and thus need reliable automated systems that can track the behavior of a person through several cameras. Person reidentification (PReID) is a simple task for this and plays a vital role in re-identifying persons from video surveillance cameras.","In this paper, we leverage the attention-based mechanism to re-identify persons from video surveillance cameras by using the image modality translation and CycleGAN, which served as data augmentation in our proposed network.

10.1109/MDM61037.2024.00060,Deciphering Human Mobility: Inferring Semantics of Trajectories with Large Language Models,Luo Y.,"Understanding human mobility patterns is essential for various applications, from urban planning to public safety. The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys.","To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns. This study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing the semantic analysis of trajectory data, paving the way for more sophisticated and accessible human mobility research."

Engaging the public in this process promises to achieve high acceptance for resulting endeavors but poses significant challenges, particularly due to the varying levels of technical and artistic skills among participants. Moreover, discussions and collaborative efforts in urban planning often lack practical visualization tools, making it difficult to imagine and debate future urban scenarios. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a promising technology capable of bridging these gaps. GenAI can generate natural language output and visual content from textual descriptions, offering a novel way to facilitate more inclusive and productive participation in urban planning processes.","In this paper, we explore the application of GenAI in a participatory urban planning event utilizing the novel Prompt-a-thon format. We conducted a study involving 64 participants who utilized GenAI in small groups to envision, design, and discuss the future urban landscape of the metropolitan city of Hamburg in Germany. Through this process, we examined the human-AI collaboration, assessing the technology's ability to accommodate varying skills and improve visualization in planning discussions. Our findings indicate that GenAI contributes to leveling diverse skill sets of participants, enabling more people to contribute insights into urban planning discussions. The technology also proved effective in overcoming visualization barriers, thus facilitating more engaging and fruitful discussions about future urban scenarios. These results underscore the potential of GenAI as a valuable tool in the evolving landscape of urban planning and public participation."

10.32604/cmc.2024.047836,An Enhanced Multiview Transformer for Population Density Estimation Using Cellular Mobility Data in Smart City,Zhou Y.,"This paper addresses the problem of predicting population density leveraging cellular station data. As wireless communication devices are commonly used, cellular station data has become integral for estimating population figures and studying their movement, thereby implying significant contributions to urban planning. However, existing research grapples with issues pertinent to preprocessing base station data and the modeling of population prediction. To address this, we propose methodologies for preprocessing cellular station data to eliminate any irregular or redundant data. The preprocessing reveals a distinct cyclical characteristic and high-frequency variation in population shift. Further, we devise a multi-view enhancement model grounded on the Transformer (MVformer), targeting the improvement of the accuracy of extended time-series population predictions. Comparative experiments, conducted on the above-mentioned population dataset using four alternate Transformer-based models, indicate that our proposed MVformer model enhances prediction accuracy by approximately 30% for both univariate and multivariate time-series prediction assignments. The performance of this model in tasks pertaining to population prediction exhibits commendable results.","This paper addresses the problem of predicting population density leveraging cellular station data.

A key challenge in trajectory generation is to best capture the basic characteristics of the long sequences of location points. This is non-trivial considering the inherent sequentiality and high-dimensionality of trajectory data.","This paper presents TS-TrajGAN, a two-stage model to generate spatiotemporal trajectory data by combining a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a conditional GAN. We train the GAN of stage I to simulate the distribution of the initial trajectory segments such that the basic characteristics of the length-limited initial trajectory segments can be well depicted. In stage II, the conditional GAN is used to predict the next location point for the current generated trajectory and preserve the variability in individuals’ mobility. In addition, a predictor network is added to the GAN of stage I for trajectory length prediction. Experiments on a real-world taxi dataset demonstrate that TS-TrajGAN is not only able to generate trajectories that have similar characteristics with the real ones, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of data utility.

To address the intricate nature of transportation issues, many researchers and planners have analyzed the complexities of urban and regional road systems using transportation models by employing transportation indices such as road length, network density, accessibility, and connectivity metrics.","This study addresses the complexities of predicting road network density for small and medium-sized Indian cities that come under the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) project at a national level. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and the CityGAN model is introduced to predict network density using spatial indicators of human settlements. The major goal of this study is to generate hyper-realistic urban patterns of small and medium-sized Indian cities using an unsupervised CityGAN model and to study the causal relationship between human settlement indices (HSIs) and transportation index (network density) using supervised KRR for the real cities. The synthetic urban universes mimic Indian urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through the settlement indices can aid in comprehending urban landscape, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. We analyzed 503 real cities to find the actual relationship between the urban settlements and their road density. The nonlinear KRR model may help urban planners in deriving the network density for GAN-generated futuristic urban patterns through the settlement indicators. The proposed hybrid process, termed as RidgeGAN model, can gauge the sustainability of urban sprawl tied to infrastructure and transportation systems in sprawling cities. Analysis results clearly demonstrate the utility of RidgeGAN in predicting network density for different kinds of human settlements, particularly for small and medium Indian cities. By predicting future urban patterns, this study can help in the creation of more livable and sustainable areas, particularly by improving transportation infrastructure in developing cities."

Current systems adopt cameras and wireless sensors to estimate people's locations via sensor fusion. Standard fusion algorithms, however, become inapplicable when multi-modal data is not associated. For example, pedestrians are out of the camera field of view, or data from the camera modality is missing.","To address this challenge and produce more accurate location estimations for pedestrians, we propose a localization solution based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. During training, it learns the underlying linkage between pedestrians' camera-phone data correspondences. During inference, it generates refined position estimations based only on pedestrians' phone data that consists of GPS, IMU, and FTM. Results show that our GAN produces 3D coordinates at 1 to 2 meters localization error across 5 different outdoor scenes. We further show that the proposed model supports self-learning. The generated coordinates can be associated with pedestrians' bounding box coordinates to obtain additional camera-phone data correspondences. This allows automatic data collection during inference. Results show that after fine-tuning the GAN model on the expanded dataset, localization accuracy is further improved by up to 26%."

However, the real-world human trajectory data tends to be limited by user privacy or device acquisition issues, leading to its insufficient quality to support the above applications. Hence, generating human trajectory data is a crucial but challenging task, which suffers from the following two critical challenges: 1) how to capture the user distribution in human trajectories (group view), and 2) how to model the complex mobility patterns of each user trajectory (individual view).","In this paper, we propose a novel human trajectories generator (named VOLUNTEER), consisting of a user VAE and a trajectory VAE, to address the above challenges. Specifically, in the user VAE, we propose to learn the user distribution with all human trajectories from a group view. In the trajectory VAE, from the individual view, we model the complex mobility patterns by decoupling travel time and dwell time to accurately simulate individual trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art baselines.

The Apriori algorithm is extended with spatio-temporal constraints to extract frequent transit mobility patterns of individual passengers based on a reconstructed personal trip dataset. This individual-level pattern information is used to construct personalized feature vectors. For regular and frequent public transit passengers, we identify similar transit mobility groups using spatio-temporal constraints to construct a group feature vector. We develop a generative adversarial network to embed public transit mobility of passengers. The proposed model’s generator consists of an auto-encoder, which extracts a low-dimensional and compact representation of passenger behavior, and a pre-trained sub-generator containing generalization features of public transit passengers. Shenzhen City is taken as the study area in this paper, and experiments were carried out based on smart card data, road network data, and bus GPS data. Clustering analysis of embedding vector representation and estimation of the top K transit destinations were conducted, verifying that the proposed method can profile passenger transit mobility in a comprehensive and compact manner."

In this research, we take Shanghai, one of the global cities in China with a big labour market, as the research sample. First, we use the Point of Interest (POI) data to draw the heatmap of urban amenities that support workers’ daily life and collect the corresponding city maps. Then, we cut them into hundreds of image pairs as the training set and train a GAN model for predicting the future amenities distributions in other cities.

10.1109/MDM58254.2023.00032,CSGAN: Modality-Aware Trajectory Generation via Clustering-based Sequence GAN,Zhang M.,"Human mobility data is useful for various applications in urban planning, transportation, and public health, but collecting and sharing real-world trajectories can be challenging due to privacy and data quality issues. To address these problems, recent research focuses on generating synthetic trajectories, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained by real-world trajectories.","In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets show the superiority of our model in various metrics over state-of-the-art models."

The explosion of mobility data prompted the application of deep learning to human mobility. Along with the growth of research interest, there is also increasing privacy concern.","This study first examines the cutting-edge approaches for trajectory generation, classification, and next-location prediction. Second, we propose a novel privacy-aware approach for predicting next-week trajectories. The approach is based on two modules, a Generative Adversarial Network used for generating synthetic trajectories and a deep learning model for user identification which safeguards privacy. These two modules are combined with a next-week trajectory predictor that uses privacy-aware synthetic data. The experiments on two real-life datasets show that the generator creates trajectories similar to the real ones yet different enough to safeguard privacy. The low user-recognition recognition accuracy of models trained on the generated data demonstrates privacy awareness. Statistical tests confirm no significant difference between the original and the generated trajectories. We further demonstrate the utility of the synthetic data by predicting week-ahead trajectories based on the synthetic trajectories. Our study shows how privacy and utility can be managed jointly using the proposed privacy-aware approach."
10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101852,Generative population synthesis for joint household and individual characteristics,Aemmer Z.,"Household surveys provide immense value in the fields of transportation and urban planning. However, even the most well-funded surveying agencies rely on sampling methods to estimate the nature of the true population, and the collected microdata is frequently aggregated, or limited in volume and detail to protect the privacy of respondents. Population synthesis provides a means to scale this microdata to represent larger regions for use in microsimulation. Despite their accuracy and widespread adoption, traditional synthesis algorithms for reweighting microdata samples scale poorly with the number of variables and geographic regions being modeled, and can suffer from non-convergence with smaller sample sizes. Several generative models have been proposed to address these shortcomings, but lack features such as sub-region modeling, and the ability to simultaneously generate both individuals and households.","This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4–16 variables). The VAE/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples."

This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines. We also showcase that TrafficGAN can identify potential traffic issues in some regions and suggest possible reasons."

Current research uses data mining of tweets and specific posts to provide population trends, but there is no work done in social network analysis for the same end.","This paper proposes an applied informatics application with social network usage to aid in the lack of data due to nonexistent traffic sensors. The Twitter API was used to download a network of users that follows traffic updates accounts and then, use a model of information diffusion (independent cascade model) to retrieve a variable that holds a metric of how the information regarding current traffic has traveled through the network. Finally, an updated traffic dataset with the new social network variable is used to train and validate an LSTM neural network to show if the new variable can be a predictor for traffic. Results show that a deterministic independent cascade model ran on a New York City-based 2-tier social network marginally improved the prediction by 0.4%.

The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used pedestrian attribute data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CSVFL approach outperforms multiple recently reported pedestrian gender recognition methods."

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3053704,Unsupervised domain adaptation in activity recognition: A gan-based approach,Sanabria A.R.,"Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is having a significant impact in a wide range of applications in smart city, smart home, and personal healthcare. Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains.","This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data."
