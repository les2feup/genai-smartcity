10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2025.102252,GeoAvatar: A big mobile phone positioning data-driven method for individualized pseudo personal mobility data generation,Li P.,"The importance of personal mobility data is widely recognized in various fields. However, the utilization of real personal mobility data raises privacy concerns. Therefore, it is crucial to generate pseudo personal mobility data that accurately reflects real-world mobility patterns while safeguarding user privacy. Nevertheless, existing methods for generating pseudo mobility data, mostly focusing on trip or trajectory generation, have limitations in capturing sufficient individual heterogeneity. To address these gaps, taking pseudo-person(avatar) as ground-zero, a novel individual-based human mobility generator named GeoAvatar has been proposed – which considering individual heterogeneity in spatial and temporal decision-making, incorporates demographic characteristics.","Our method utilizes a deep generative model to generate heterogeneous individual life patterns, a variation inference model for inferring individual demographic characteristics, and a Bayesian-based approach for generating spatial choices considering individual demographic characteristics. Through our method, we have achieved generating realistic pseudo personal human mobility data - we evaluated the proposed method based on physical features – obeying common law of human mobility, activity features – showing diverse and realistic activities, and spatial-temporal characteristics – presenting high-accuracy in terms of temporal grid population and od-count, demonstrating its good performance, with both a big mobile phone GPS trajectory dataset from Tokyo Metropolis and a big mobile phone CDR dataset from Shanghai. Furthermore, this method maintains extensibility for broader applications, making it a promising framework for generating pseudo personal human mobility data."
10.1016/j.aap.2024.107908,Can we realize seamless traffic safety at smart intersections by predicting and preventing impending crashes?,Hassan Anik B.M.T.,"Intersections are frequently identified as crash hotspots for roadways in major cities, leading to significant human casualties.","We propose crash likelihood prediction as an effective strategy to proactively prevent intersection crashes. So far, no reliable models have been developed for intersections that effectively account for the variation in crash types and the cyclical nature of Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) and traffic flow. Moreover, the limited research available has primarily relied on sampling techniques to address data imbalance, without exploring alternative solutions. We develop an anomaly detection framework by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to predict the likelihood of cycle-level crashes at intersections. The model is built using high-resolution event data extracted from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM), including SPaT and traffic flow insights from 11 intersections in Seminole County, Florida. Our framework demonstrates a sensitivity of 76% in predicting crash events using highly imbalanced crash data along with real-world SPaT and traffic data, highlighting its potential for deployment at smart intersections. Overall, the results provide a roadmap for city-wide implementation at smart intersections, with the potential for multiple real-time solutions for impending crashes. These include adjustments in signal timing, driver warnings using various means, and more efficient emergency response, all with major implications for creating more livable and safe cities."

Bike network planning is a tedious process, relying on heuristic computational methods that frequently overlook the broader implications of introducing new cycling infrastructure, in particular the necessity to repurpose car lanes.","In this work, we call for optimizing the trade-off between bike and car networks, effectively pushing for Pareto optimality. This shift in perspective gives rise to a novel linear programming formulation towards optimal bike network allocation. Our experiments, conducted using both real-world and synthetic data, testify the effectiveness and superiority of this optimization approach compared to heuristic methods. In particular, the framework provides stakeholders with a range of lane reallocation scenarios, illustrating potential bike network enhancements and their implications for car infrastructure. Crucially, our approach is adaptable to various bikeability and car accessibility evaluation criteria, making our tool a highly flexible and scalable resource for urban planning. This paper presents an advanced decision-support framework that can significantly aid urban planners in making informed decisions on cycling infrastructure development."
10.1016/j.apacoust.2024.110268,A rapid approach to urban traffic noise mapping with a generative adversarial network,Yang X.,"With rapid urbanisation and the accompanying increase in traffic density, traffic noise has become a major concern in urban planning. However, traditional grid noise mapping methods have limitations in terms of time consumption, software costs, and a lack of parameter integration interfaces. These limitations hinder their ability to meet the need for iterative updates and rapid performance feedback in the early design stages of street-scale urban planning. Herein, we developed a rapid urban traffic noise mapping technique that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a surrogate model.","This approach enables the rapid assessment of urban traffic noise distribution by using urban elements such as roads and buildings as the input. The mean values for the mean squared error (RMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are 0.3024 dB(A) and 0.8528, respectively, for the validation dataset. The trained model is integrated into Grasshopper as a tool, facilitating the rapid generation of traffic noise maps. This integration allows urban designers and planners, even those without expertise in acoustics, to easily anticipate changes in acoustics impacts caused by design in the early design stages."

Despite the central role of roads as the primary conduit for traffic flow and a direct exposure variable in accidents, their impact on spatial correlation in accident analysis has not been fully explored.","This study introduces an innovative spatial correlation matrix, termed the road matrix, which incorporates shared road lengths between grids to enhance accident prediction accuracy. The model examines the relationship between traffic accidents and various predictor variables, including land use, road networks, and public transportation facilities. Compared to traditional spatial correlation methods such as the rook and queen matrices, the road matrix provides a more precise characterization of spatial dependencies and significantly improves accident frequency estimation. Notably, the application of the road matrix within a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model uncovers additional significant contributors to traffic accidents, such as the number of interchanges and the length of nonexpress arterial roads.

Identifying pavement materials is a key factor in assessing mobility, such as walkability and wheelchair usability. However, satellite imagery in this scenario is limited, and in situ mapping can be costly. A promising solution is to extract such geospatial features from street-level imagery.","This study explores using open-vocabulary classification algorithms to segment and identify pavement types and surface materials in this scenario. Our approach uses large language models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy of classifying different pavement types. The methodology involves two experiments: the first uses free prompting with random street-view images, employing Grounding Dino and SAM algorithms to assess performance across categories. The second experiment evaluates standardized pavement classification using the Deep Pavements dataset and a fine-tuned CLIP algorithm optimized for detecting OSM-compliant pavement categories.

10.1145/3678717.3691296,Towards Zero-Shot Annotation of the Built Environment with Vision-Language Models,Han B.,"Equitable urban transportation applications require high-fidelity digital representations of the built environment (streets, crossings, curb ramps and more). Direct inspections and manual annotations are costly at scale, while conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance.","This study explores vision language models as a tool for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation. Although these models excel at describing common objects in human-centric images, their training sets may lack signals for esoteric built environment features, making their performance uncertain. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a vision language model and a visual prompting strategy that considers segmented image elements. Experiments on two urban features - stop lines and raised tables - show that while zero-shot prompting rarely works, the segmentation and visual prompting strategies achieve nearly 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results motivate further research in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at scale and in diverse environments."

Traditional OD prediction models, while effective within single cities, often face limitations when applied across different cities due to varied traffic conditions, urban layouts, and socio-economic factors.","In this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art learning-based methods in cross-city OD flow prediction."
10.1145/3678717.3691311,MobGLM: A Large Language Model for Synthetic Human Mobility Generation,Zhang K.,"Human mobility generation plays a critical role in urban transportation planning. Existing human mobility generation models often fall short of understanding travelers’ demographics and integrating multimodal information, including activity purposes, destination choices and transport mode preferences. Recently, mobility generation models leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention, while they are limited in directly reproducing spatial information in human mobility profiles.","To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Mobility Generative Language Model (MobGLM), a novel approach for generating synthetic human mobility data to support urban planning, transport management, energy consumption and epidemic control. MobGLM addresses these limitations by capturing the complex relationships between agents’ mobility patterns and individual demographics.

10.1016/j.jfranklin.2024.107299,Spatial–Temporal Similarity Fusion Graph Adversarial Convolutional Networks for traffic flow forecasting,Wang B.,Traffic flow forecasting is integral to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and the development of smart cities.,"This paper introduces a novel model, the Spatial–Temporal Similarity Fusion Graphs Adversarial Convolutional Networks (STSF-GACN), which leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques to enhance the predictive accuracy and efficiency of traffic flow forecasting. The innovation of our approach lies in the meticulous construction of the spatial–temporal similarity matrix through the precise calculation of temporal and spatial similarities. This matrix forms the backbone of our model, serving as the generator in the integrated Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The Spatial–Temporal Similarity Fusion Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network, developed as part of our GAN's generator, utilizes cutting-edge techniques such as the Wasserstein distance and Dynamic Time Warping to optimize the adaptive adjacency matrix, enabling the model to capture latent spatial–temporal correlations with unprecedented depth and precision. The discriminator of the GAN further refines the model by evaluating the accuracy of the traffic predictions, ensuring that the generative model produces results that are not only accurate but also robust against varying traffic conditions.

10.1016/j.trc.2024.104798,A conditional diffusion model for probabilistic estimation of traffic states at sensor-free locations,Lei D.,"Transportation administrators and urban planners rely on accurate network-wide traffic state estimation to make well-informed decisions. However, due to insufficient sensor coverage, traffic state estimation at sensor-free locations (TSES) poses significant challenges for downstream network-wide traffic analysis. This is because direct observations are not available at these sensor-free locations. Most existing traffic state estimation (TSE) research focuses on inferring several unknown time points based on observed historical data using deterministic models. In contrast, TSES is to infer the entire unknown traffic time series of a given sensor-free node, thereby presenting high predictive difficulty, as we could not learn any historical traffic patterns locally.","In this study, we introduce a novel probabilistic model — the conditional diffusion framework with spatio-temporal estimator (CDSTE) — to tackle the TSES problem. When dealing with TSES, deterministic models can only produce point value estimates, which may substantially deviate from the actual traffic states of sensor-free locations. To mitigate this, the proposed CDSTE integrates the conditional diffusion framework with cutting-edge spatio-temporal networks to extract the underlying dependencies in traffic states between sensor-free and sensor-equipped nodes. This integration enables reliable probabilistic traffic state estimations for sensor-free locations, which can be used to quantify the variability of estimations in TSES to support flexible and robust decision-making processes for traffic management and control. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CDSTE for TSES over five widely-used baseline models."
10.1016/j.trc.2024.104748,Cooperative adaptable lanes for safer shared space and improved mixed-traffic flow,Dubey R.K.,"With the rapid increase in the percentage of the world's population living in cities, the design of existing transportation infrastructure requires serious consideration. Current road networks, especially in large cities, face acute pressures due to increased demand for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Although much attention has been given to improve traffic management and accommodate the increased demand via coordinating and optimizing traffic signals, research focused on adapting the static allocation of street spaces and right-of-way dynamically based on mixed traffic flow is still scarce.","This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) agent approach that cooperatively adapts the individual lane widths and right-of-way access permissions based on real-world mixed traffic flow. In particular, multiple cooperative agents are trained with mixed temporal data that learn to decide suitable lane widths for motorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, along with whether co-sharing space between pedestrians and cyclists is safe. Using a microscopic traffic simulator model of a four-legged intersection, we trained our RL agent on synthetic data, and tested it on realistic multi-modal traffic data. The proposed approach reduces the overall average waiting time and queue length by 48.9% and 37.7%, respectively, compared to the Static (baseline) street design. Additionally, we observe CALM's ability to gradually adjust lane widths, contrasting with the Heuristic implementation's erratic lane adjustments, which pose potential safety concerns. Notably, the model learns to adaptively toggle the co-sharing of street space between cyclists and pedestrians as one co-shared lane, ensuring comfort and maintaining the level of service according to the designer's policy. Finally, we demonstrate CALM's scalability on a simulated large-scale traffic network."

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability.","To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts."
10.3390/ijgi13060203,Generating Urban Road Networks with Conditional Diffusion Models,Gu X.,"The auto-generation of urban roads can greatly improve efficiency and productivity in urban planning and designing. However, it has also raised concerns amongst researchers over the past decade.","In this paper, we present an image-based urban road network generation framework using conditional diffusion models. We first trained a diffusion model capable of generating road images with similar characteristics to the ground truth using four context factors. Then, we used the trained model as the generator to synthesize road images conditioned in a geospatial context. Finally, we converted the generated road images into road networks with several post-processes. The experiments conducted in five cities of the United States showed that our model can generate reasonable road networks, maintaining the layouts and styles of real examples. Moreover, our model has the ability to show the obstructive effect of geographic barriers on urban roads. By comparing models with different context factors as input, we find that the model that considers all four factors generally performs the best. The most important factor in guiding the shape of road networks is intersections, implying that the development of urban roads is not only restricted by the natural environment but is more strongly influenced by human design."

However, gathering and disseminating mobility data face challenges such as data collection, handling of missing information, and privacy protection. An alternative to tackle these problems consists of modeling raw data to generate synthetic data, preserving its characteristics while maintaining its privacy.","Thus, we propose MobDeep, a unified framework to compare and evaluate generative models of time series based on mobility data features, which considers statistical and deep learning-based modeling. To achieve its goal, MobDeep receives as input statistical or Generative Adversarial Network-based models (GANs) and the raw mobility data, and outputs synthetic data and the metrics comparing the synthetic with the original data. In such way, MobDeep allows evaluating synthetic datasets through qualitative and quantitative metrics. As a proof-of-concept, MobDeep implements one classical statistical model (ARIMA) and three GANs models. To demonstrate MobDeep on distinct mobility scenarios, we considered an open dataset containing information about bicycle rentals in US cities and a private dataset containing information about a Brazilian metropolis’s urban traffic. MobDeep allows observing how each model performs in specific scenarios, depending on the characteristics of the mobility data. Therefore, by using MobDeep researchers can evaluate their resulting models, improving the fidelity of the synthetic data regarding the original dataset."

Current approaches using ma-chine learning and deep neural networks have advanced traffic prediction but often focus on individual urban dynamic aspects and rely on auto-regressive methods for consecutive predictions, which can be inaccurate and computationally expensive.","In this work, we propose the Spatial- Temporal Graph LAtent DIffusion ModeL (STGAIL) to address these limitations. STGAIL views geographical regions as graphs with various traffic features, capturing their interconnections. Operating in a pre-trained latent space, STGAIL uses latent diffusion processes and inno-vative spatial-temporal graph layers for accurate and efficient multi-step predictions. Fine-tuning with temporal binary masks further enhances its performance, avoiding error accumulation and reducing computational costs. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate STGAIL's superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Advanced analytics uncover hidden patterns and behaviors, and visualization tools map data onto the urban layout to facilitate spatial planning and resource allocation. Scenario simulation enables urban planners to assess the impact of different strategies in a virtual environment prior to real-world implementation. The integration of Generative Artificial Intel- ligence (GenAl) models further enhances predictive capabilities and scenario generation. Preliminary results demonstrate the DT platform's potential in improving urban mobility management, particularly in optimizing parking meter placement and enhancing user experience.

However, the wireless communication channels in modern networks are fragile due to the blockages by buildings in dense urban environments. Particularly, moving vehicles may get off the beam direction, leading to a loss of signals.","Therefore, in this paper, we deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide stable aerial wireless communication channels for Internet-of-autonomous vehicles (IoA Vs), assisted by ground reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Nevertheless, the path planning for the UAV is challenging as the UAV should maneuver among the skyscrapers. This requires energy-efficient obstacle-free path planning while considering UAV kinematics, i.e., speed, nonholonomic constraints, etc. Besides, the UAV should fly through the paths that provide maximum line-of-sight (LoS) channels for IoA Vs, which increases the time complexity of the path planner. To tackle the issue, we introduce deep learning-based generative adversarial networks (GANs) as the UAV path planner for real-time path planning and autonomous navigation. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique."

Existing literature lacks both an examination of these biases and a solution.","This study identifies and quantifies these biases by comparing conventional SVI with views from the road shoulder/sidewalk. To mitigate such perspective biases, we introduce a novel framework with generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image generation models (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN), an image regression model (ResNet-50), and a tabular model (LightGBM). Experiments assessed model effectiveness in translating car-centric views to those from pedestrian and cyclist perspectives. Results show significant differences in semantic indicators (e.g. green view index) between road center and road shoulder/sidewalk SVI, with low Pearson’s correlation coefficients r (0.35–0.55 for road shoulders and 0.45–0.47 for sidewalks) indicating bias. The framework succeeded in creating realistic images and aligning pixel ratios between perspectives, achieving strong correlation coefficients (0.81 for road shoulders and 0.83 for sidewalks), thus reducing bias. This work contributes by providing a scalable and model-agnostic approach to produce accurate SVIs for urban planning and sustainability, setting a foundation for improving bikeability and walkability assessments and promoting active transportation."

However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation.","In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research.

To address the intricate nature of transportation issues, many researchers and planners have analyzed the complexities of urban and regional road systems using transportation models by employing transportation indices such as road length, network density, accessibility, and connectivity metrics.","This study addresses the complexities of predicting road network density for small and medium-sized Indian cities that come under the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) project at a national level. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and the CityGAN model is introduced to predict network density using spatial indicators of human settlements. The major goal of this study is to generate hyper-realistic urban patterns of small and medium-sized Indian cities using an unsupervised CityGAN model and to study the causal relationship between human settlement indices (HSIs) and transportation index (network density) using supervised KRR for the real cities. The synthetic urban universes mimic Indian urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through the settlement indices can aid in comprehending urban landscape, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. We analyzed 503 real cities to find the actual relationship between the urban settlements and their road density. The nonlinear KRR model may help urban planners in deriving the network density for GAN-generated futuristic urban patterns through the settlement indicators. The proposed hybrid process, termed as RidgeGAN model, can gauge the sustainability of urban sprawl tied to infrastructure and transportation systems in sprawling cities. Analysis results clearly demonstrate the utility of RidgeGAN in predicting network density for different kinds of human settlements, particularly for small and medium Indian cities.

However, various factors in complex scenes (e.g., high vegetation coverage occlusions) may lead to fragmentation in the extracted road networks and also affect the robustness of road extraction methods.","This study proposes a multi-scale road extraction method with asymmetric generative adversarial learning (MS-AGAN). First, we design an asymmetric GAN with a multi-scale feature encoder to better utilize the context information in high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and feature fusion are integrated into the asymmetric encoder–decoder structure to avoid feature redundancy caused by multi-level cascading operations and enhance the generator network’s ability to extract fine-grained road information at the pixel level. Second, to maintain road connectivity, topologic features are considered in the pixel segmentation process. A linear structural similarity loss ((Formula presented.)) is introduced into the loss function of MS-AGAN, which guides MS-AGAN to generate more accurate segmentation results. Finally, to fairly evaluate the performance of deep models under complex backgrounds, the Bayesian error rate (BER) is introduced into the field of road extraction for the first time. Experiments are conducted via Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images with high vegetation coverage in the Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the public DeepGlobe dataset. The performance of MS-AGAN is compared with a list of advanced models, including RCFSNet, CoANet, UNet, DeepLabV3+, and DiResNet. The final results show that (1) with respect to road extraction performance, the Recall, F1, and IoU values of MS-AGAN on the Daxing dataset are 2.17%, 0.04%, and 2.63% higher than the baselines. On DeepGlobe, the Recall, F1, and IoU of MS-AGAN improve by 1.12%, 0.42%, and 0.25%, respectively. (2) On road connectivity, the Conn index of MS-AGAN from the Daxing dataset is 46.39%, with an improvement of 0.62% over the baselines, and the Conn index of MS-AGAN on DeepGlobe is 70.08%, holding an improvement of 1.73% over CoANet. The quantitative and qualitative analyses both demonstrate the superiority of MS-AGAN in preserving road connectivity. (3) In particular, the BER of MS-AGAN is 20.86% over the Daxing dataset with a 0.22% decrease compared to the best baselines and 11.77% on DeepGlobe with a 0.85% decrease compared to the best baselines.

These applications often require dense trajectories, which is often not the case due to power limitations and privacy concerns.","To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network-based model, namely TIGAN, for trajectory imputation. TIGAN inserts artificial GPS points between real ones, resulting in imputed trajectories that closely resemble those collected at much higher sampling rates. Unlike existing works, TIGAN does not require prior knowledge such as underlying road networks.

To address these problems, recent research focuses on generating synthetic trajectories, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained by real-world trajectories.","In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets show the superiority of our model in various metrics over state-of-the-art models."

However, the release of original trajectory data violates privacy protection principles if no privacy-preserving approach is adopted, that's why the public trajectory data for research is so limited.","To enable extensive available trajectory data publishing, we propose a Privacy-Preserving and research-utilizable Trajectory Generator (PPTG), which uses a deep generative model to provide utilizable synthetic trajectories.

Along with the growth of research interest, there is also increasing privacy concern.","This study first examines the cutting-edge approaches for trajectory generation, classification, and next-location prediction. Second, we propose a novel privacy-aware approach for predicting next-week trajectories. The approach is based on two modules, a Generative Adversarial Network used for generating synthetic trajectories and a deep learning model for user identification which safeguards privacy. These two modules are combined with a next-week trajectory predictor that uses privacy-aware synthetic data. The experiments on two real-life datasets show that the generator creates trajectories similar to the real ones yet different enough to safeguard privacy. The low user-recognition recognition accuracy of models trained on the generated data demonstrates privacy awareness. Statistical tests confirm no significant difference between the original and the generated trajectories. We further demonstrate the utility of the synthetic data by predicting week-ahead trajectories based on the synthetic trajectories. Our study shows how privacy and utility can be managed jointly using the proposed privacy-aware approach."

Monitoring and forecasting urban cellular traffic is fundamental for urban planning, network resources allocation, traffic engineering, etc.","In this paper, we address the crowdsourcing-based urban cellular traffic prediction problem, i.e., to predict the city-scale fine-grained cellular traffic patterns based on partial user-generated measurements. We propose a novel deep generative adversarial network (GAN) model called CrowdGAN to solve the problem. Specifically, CrowdGAN employs a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract spatio-temporal features from sparse traffic maps, and adopts a novel design of co-training a generator and a discriminator under the supervision of an accuracy assurance network to generate a high-resolution cellular traffic map for prediction. We implement the proposed CrowdGAN in TensorFlow and evaluate its performance using two real-world cellular traffic datasets. Extensive experiments show that CrowdGAN significantly outperforms the baselines on a variety of performance metrics, and achieves at least 47% reduction in root-mean-squared error compared to the state-of-the-art."
10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101852,Generative population synthesis for joint household and individual characteristics,Aemmer Z.,"Household surveys provide immense value in the fields of transportation and urban planning. However, even the most well-funded surveying agencies rely on sampling methods to estimate the nature of the true population, and the collected microdata is frequently aggregated, or limited in volume and detail to protect the privacy of respondents. Population synthesis provides a means to scale this microdata to represent larger regions for use in microsimulation. Despite their accuracy and widespread adoption, traditional synthesis algorithms for reweighting microdata samples scale poorly with the number of variables and geographic regions being modeled, and can suffer from non-convergence with smaller sample sizes. Several generative models have been proposed to address these shortcomings, but lack features such as sub-region modeling, and the ability to simultaneously generate both individuals and households.","This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4–16 variables). The VAE/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples."

This system incorporated the self-powered flexible sensors with net-zero power consumption based on the Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) and an intelligent analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI). The feasibility of the SSTIS was tested using the full-scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) and the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with a vehicle axle load classification accuracy up to 89.06%. This robust SSTIS was later tested on highway and collected around 869,600 pieces of signals data. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN - Gradient Penalty) was used for data augmentation, due to the imbalanced data of different vehicle types in actual traffic. The overall accuracy for on-road vehicle type classification improved to 81.06% using the convolutional neural network ResNet. Finally, we developed a mobile traffic signal information monitoring system based on cloud platform and Android framework, which enabled engineers to obtain the vehicle axle-load information mobilely. This study is the emerging design and engineering application of the self-powered flexible sensors for smart traffic monitoring, which provides a significant advance for intelligent transportation and smart cities in future."
10.11897/SP.J.1016.2022.01133,Trajectory Prediction in Complex Scenes Based on Multi-Head Attention Adversarial Mechanism,Yu L.,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent city construction and public crisis management. Distinct from the single trajectory prediction which rely on strong temporal correlation, in the complex scenes, the trajectory reflects not only the temporal characteristics of a single person, but the interactive features between human and other moving objects nearby. Therefore, how to deeply describe such temporality and interactivity, and then to generate accurate trajectory prediction results according to the change of the scene has become a major problem in the field of trajectory prediction today. In recent years, deep learning has attracted great attention and achieved success in the trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods capture the influence between pedestrians from a single view, and they fail to consider the multiple factors which have an effect on the decision of pedestrians, such as going straight or turning.","To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time."

Despite policy and design implications, realistic projections of future urban landscape changes were primarily obtained based on street-scale design in earlier studies, leaving questions about the successful integration of repurposed urban elements.","This study aimed to formulate design strategies in an incremental fashion applicable to large areas of cities to enhance the connectivity between AVs and existing transportation modes. A conceptual model was built referring to blocks of different forms and functions in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, to extend our designs from the street level to the district level. Urban elements—streets, public spaces and transit systems—were redesigned and merged into the patchwork concept, which links different street and zone types as an efficient system. The above urban design concept proposes the separation of AVs and regular vehicles and adopts unique linkage structures to effectively connect zones assigned to AV usage. The strategies and designs developed in this study contribute to the limited studies on city-scale future AV projections and provide spatial implications as a guideline to address preparations considering AVs in the urban space."

Due to the coupling relationship of generative factors in spatial-temporal domain, it is challenging to model the citywide traffic dynamics under a structural pattern of critical features such as hours of days, days of weeks and weather conditions.","To address this challenge, this article develops a disentangled representation learning framework to learn an interpretable factorized representation of the independent data generative factors. In order to make full use of the knowledge on generative factors, this article proposes spatial-temporal generative adversarial network (ST-GAN) to assign the generative factors of traffic flow to the feature vector in latent space and reconstructs the high-dimensional citywide traffic flow from the given factors. With the help of the disentangled representations, the decomposed feature vector in latent space discloses the relationship between underlying patterns and citywide traffic dynamics. Several comprehensively experiments show that ST-GAN not only effectively improves the prediction accuracy but also promisingly characterize structural properties of the traffic evolution process."

And even when they are, they are limited in size and spatio-temporal coverage. To address these issues a number of methods for generating synthetic yet realistic trajectory datasets have been proposed. These existing methods either require a lot of complex parameters to be calibrated (simulators) or rely on existing trajectory datasets (generative models).","In this paper, we propose Data-Driven Trajectory Generator, dubbed DDTG, a data-driven, model-free, and parameter-less algorithm for generating realistic synthetic vehicle trajectory datasets. Unlike existing approaches, DDTG relies on aggregate origin-destination and traffic data, both of which are publicly available and free of privacy concerns. Furthermore, we show that our method is orthogonal to the existing approaches with which DDTG can be combined to generate synthetic datasets of higher quality. Our experiments with real-world trajectory and traffic data show that the datasets generated by DDTG follow distributions that are very close to the distributions of real trajectory datasets."

However, most existing methods require the target city to provide a large amount of traffic data. Once traffic estimation is performed in a 'new' city where many urban services and transportation infrastructures are not built and thus no prior data is available, those works would fail due to the lack of data.","In this paper, we aim to solve the conditional urban traffic estimation problem in case of data scarcity (i.e., the target city cannot provide any prior data) and tackle the main challenges including (1) knowledge learning from the source and (2) knowledge adaptation without prior traffic data. We propose a novel generative adversarial network - Meta Spatial-Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (Mest-GAN), which can successfully estimate traffic in the target city based on local travel demands without the access to any prior traffic data. To address the first challenge, we learn the latent distribution of travel demands with the inference network, the latent distribution also indicates the diverse spatial-temporal traffic patterns. To solve the second challenge, we use the travel demand data in the target city for adaptation, where the inference network infers a latent code guiding the generator to produce accurate traffic estimations. Extensive experiments on real-world multiple-city datasets demonstrate that our Mest-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods."

Current research uses data mining of tweets and specific posts to provide population trends, but there is no work done in social network analysis for the same end.","This paper proposes an applied informatics application with social network usage to aid in the lack of data due to nonexistent traffic sensors. The Twitter API was used to download a network of users that follows traffic updates accounts and then, use a model of information diffusion (independent cascade model) to retrieve a variable that holds a metric of how the information regarding current traffic has traveled through the network. Finally, an updated traffic dataset with the new social network variable is used to train and validate an LSTM neural network to show if the new variable can be a predictor for traffic. Results show that a deterministic independent cascade model ran on a New York City-based 2-tier social network marginally improved the prediction by 0.4%. This proposal can be replicated in other information diffusion models."

However, it is very challenging since urban flow is affected by complex semantic factors and has multi-scale dependencies on both spatial and temporal dimensional features. Moreover, it’s difficult for most existing one-step urban flow prediction models to predict several future time steps in a short time accurately.","Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in video prediction and image generation, in this paper we propose a Seq2Seq Spatial-Temporal Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks named STS-GAN for multi-step urban flow prediction. We regard citywide urban flow data in successive time steps as image frames of a video. Specifically, we first design a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Encoder (STSE) to capture relative semantic factors and spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously at each time step, which consists of Residual Convolution units. Then a Seq2Seq GAN model is proposed to generate a sequence of future urban flow predictions based on historical data. Furthermore, by integrating GAN’s adversarial loss with prediction error, our STS-GAN can effectively address the blurry prediction issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale urban flow datasets in Beijing and Guangzhou, which demonstrate STS-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods."

There is a need for street designs that encourages cooperation between road users. Shared space is a street design approach that softens the demarcation of vehicles and pedestrian traffic by reducing traffic rules, traffic signals, road marking, and regulations. Understanding the interactions and trajectory formations of various VRUs will facilitate the design of safer shared spaces.","In line with this goal, this paper aims to develop a methodology for generating VRUs trajectories that accounts for behaviors and social interactions. We develop a receding horizon optimization-based pedestrian trajectory planning algorithm capable of modeling pedestrian trajectories in a variety of shared space scenarios. Focusing on three scenarios-group interactions, unidirectional interaction, and fixed obstacle interaction-case studies are performed to demonstrate the strengths of the resulting generative model. Additionally, generated trajectories are validated using two benchmark datasets - DUT and TrajNet++. The three case studies are shown to yield low or near-zero Mean Euclidean Distance and Final Displacement Error values supporting the performance validity of the models. We also analyze gait parameters (step length and step frequency) to further demonstrate the model's capability at generating realistic pedestrian trajectories."

Due to the scarcity of real-life urban traffic data, many transportation planning applications need to generate synthesized traffic flows based on the real-life trajectory datasets. However, those synthesized traffic flows can only fit the input trajectories, which are static and does not reflect the real traffic distributions.","In this paper, we use a stochastic origin-destination (OD) matrix to represent the density of the dynamic traffic flows and then develop a dynamic traffic flow generator. We extract the stochastic OD matrix from the trajectory data, design an efficient neural network to the predict successive stochastic OD matrices, and deploy our model on a real-world road network. The proposed model surpasses the existing generative model in RMSE, MAE, VAR, KL indicators, and is significantly better than the existing model in the MAE indicator. Our traffic generator is able to dynamically adjust urban traffics to generate different simulation environments."

To do this, one-off studies with concrete data sets are not enough and a standard statistical production process must be put in place.","We propose a concrete modular process structured into evolvable modules detaching the strongly technological layer underlying this data source from the necessary statistical analysis producing outputs of interest. This architecture follows the principles of the so-called ESS Reference Methodological Framework for Mobile Network Data. Each of these modules deals with a different aspect of this data source. We apply hidden Markov models for the geolocation of mobile devices, use a Bayesian approach on this model to disambiguate devices belonging to the same individual, compute aggregate numbers of individuals detected by a telecommunication network using probability theory, and model hierarchically the integration of auxiliary information from the telco market and official data to produce final estimates of the number of individuals across different territorial regions in the target population. A first simple illustrative proposal has been applied to synthetic data providing preliminary software tools and accuracy indicators monitoring the performance of the process. Currently, this exercise has been applied to the estimation of present population and origin-destination matrices.

This work aims to model human mobility patterns to generate realistic ride-requests, addressing the prevailing problem of lack of historical training data and realistic synthetic data for different hypothetical scenarios. Synthetic generation also inherently carries anonymity. In particular, our work focuses on modeling both spatial and temporal distributions jointly for ride-hailing services. A Ride-Request Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (RR-WGAN) is proposed to generate plausible pick-up and drop-off geolocations. The generated ride-requests are extensively evaluated under a wide range of criteria we design, giving a comprehensive understanding of how the model performs. The proposed approach has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art methods in most scenarios.

The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used pedestrian attribute data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CSVFL approach outperforms multiple recently reported pedestrian gender recognition methods."

In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on publicly available datasets RoadScene and TNO demonstrate the superiority of our FusionADA over the state-of-the-art approaches."
10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00196,C 3 -GAN: Complex-Condition-Controlled Urban Traffic Estimation through Generative Adversarial Networks,Zhang Y.,"Given historical traffic distributions and associated urban conditions observed in a city, the conditional urban traffic estimation problem aims at estimating realistic future projections of the traffic under a set of new urban conditions, e.g., new bus routes, rainfall intensity and travel demands. The problem is important in reducing traffic congestion, improving public transportation efficiency, and facilitating urban planning. However, solving this problem is challenging due to the strong spatial dependencies of traffic patterns and the complex relations between the traffic and urban conditions.","In this paper, we tackle the challenges by proposing a novel Complex-Condition-Controlled Urban Traffic Estimation through Generative Adversarial Networks (C3-GAN) for urban traffic estimation of a region under various complex conditions. C3-GAN features the following three novel designs on top of standard cGAN model: (1) an embedding network mapping the complex conditions to a latent space to find representations of the urban conditions; (2) an inference network to enhance the relations between the embedded latent vectors and the traffic data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our C3-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods."

In addition, we adopt simulation tools and generative adversarial networks to train the trajectory prediction model so that the private vehicle trajectory dataset conforming to social rules (e.g., collisionless) is generated. Finally, we construct from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives to verify dataset generation methods proposed in this paper. The results show that the generated data not only has high accuracy and is valuable but can provide strong data support for the Internet of Vehicles and transportation research work."
10.1007/978-981-16-2629-6_4,"Experimenting the Impact of Pedestrianisation on Urban Pollution Using Tangible Agent-Based Simulations: Application to Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi, Vietnam",Brugière A.,"The development of permanent or temporary pedestrian areas, whether for leisure or to decrease air pollution, has become an integral part of urban planning in numerous cities around the world. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, began to implement its first area, around the iconic Hoan Kiem lake, a few years ago. In most of cases, however, road closure is likely to deport traffic to nearby neighbourhoods with the consequences of intensifying congestion and, possibly, increasing air pollution in these areas. Because this outcome might appear counter-intuitive to most stakeholders, it is becoming more and more necessary to analyse, assess and share the impacts of these developments in terms of traffic and pollution shifts before implementing them. In this project, we used the GAMA platform to build an agent-based model that simulates the traffic, its emissions of air pollutants, and the diffusion of these pollutants in the district of Hoan Kiem. This simulation has been designed so as to serve either as a decision support tool for local authorities or as an awareness-raising tool for the general public: thanks to its display on a physical 3D model of the district, people can effectively and naturally interact with it at public venues. Although more accurate data and more realistic diffusion models are necessary and will need further research in the future, the simulation is already able to reflect traffic and air pollution peaks during rush hours, allowing residents and developers to understand the impact of pedestrianization on air quality in different scenarios.","The development of permanent or temporary pedestrian areas, whether for leisure or to decrease air pollution, has become an integral part of urban planning in numerous cities around the world.

10.1016/j.procs.2021.03.035,"STS-EPR: Modelling individual mobility considering the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions together",Cornacchia G.,"Modelling human mobility is crucial in several scientific areas, from urban planning to epidemic modeling, traffic forecasting, and what-if analysis. On the one hand, existing models focus on the spatial and temporal dimensions of mobility only, while the social dimension is often neglected. On other hand, models that embed a social mechanism have trivial or unrealistic spatial and temporal mechanisms.","We propose STS-EPR, a mechanistic model that captures the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of human mobility together. Our results show that STS-EPR generates realistic trajectories, making it better than models that lack either in the social, the spatial, or the temporal mechanisms. STS-EPR is a step towards the design of mechanistic models that can capture all the aspects of human mobility in a comprehensive way."
10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101526,Population mobility modelling for mobility data simulation,Smolak K.,"Mobility models have a broad range of applications in areas related to human movements, such as urban planning, transportation, and simulations of diseases spread. In the last decade, the extensive geolocated user trajectories collected from mobile devices allowed for more realistic mobility modelling, improving its accuracy. However, mobility data sharing raises privacy concerns, which in turn limits accessibility to the data.","In this paper, we propose a WHO-WHERE-WHEN (3W) model, an improved privacy-protective mobility modelling method for synthetic mobility data generation. Based on real trajectories, it produces artificial user mobility trajectories that simulate population fluctuations in a study area, and thus preserves the individual's privacy. The model simulates the individual spatiotemporal aspects of lives accurately, representing real population flows and distributions. The proposed method was inspired by the Work and Home Extracted REgions (WHERE) algorithm, but we have extended it by considering the activity space and circadian rhythm of people. Furthermore, we propose a clustering approach to capture and reproduce the heterogeneous characteristic of mobility. We evaluate our model and compare its performance to the WHERE algorithm on the synthetic and real data test cases. Use of the 3W model improved the accuracy of population distribution reproduction by 35% measured using Earth Mover's Distance. The travel distances and the spatial distribution of the flows reproduced by the 3W model match input data with high accuracy. We also evaluate the level of privacy protection by comparing synthesised and input datasets. We find that no daily trajectory can be matched between input and synthesised datasets and the average length of the matching sequence of visited locations to contain only two locations."
10.1007/978-3-030-63820-7_61,RoadNetGAN: Generating Road Networks in Planar Graph Representation,Owaki T.,"We propose RoadNetGAN, a road network generation method as an extension to NetGAN, a generative model that can generate graphs similar to real-world networks with the acquisition of similarity measure through learning. Our main contribution is twofold. Firstly, we added displacement attributes to the random walks to generate not only the sequence but also the spatial position of nodes as intersections within a road network to be generated, which increases the diversity of generated road network patterns including the shape of the city blocks. Secondly, we make the generator and discriminator neural networks conditional. This allows for learning of the specification of the initial node of random walks over a graph, which is especially important for interactive road network generation that is mostly used in the applications for urban planning of road networks. We demonstrate that the proposed method can generate road networks that mimic the real road networks with the desired similarity.","We propose RoadNetGAN, a road network generation method as an extension to NetGAN, a generative model that can generate graphs similar to real-world networks with the acquisition of similarity measure through learning.

10.1109/SBESC49506.2019.9046091,Brazilian Mercosur License Plate Detection: A Deep Learning Approach Relying on Synthetic Imagery,Ribeiro V.,"Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology is a powerful technology enabling more efficient and effective law enforcement, security, payment collection, and research. A common license plate standard was adopted by the member states of the Mercosur trading bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and consequently requires an upgrade to the ALPR software used by law enforcement and industry. Due to the scarcity of real license plate images, training state-of-the-art supervised detectors is unfeasible unless data augmentation techniques and synthetic training data are used.","This paper presents an accurate and efficient automated Mercosur license plate detector using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained exclusively with synthetic imagery. In order to obtain the synthetic training data, Mercosur license plates were faithfully reproduced. Digital image processing techniques were employed to reduce the domain gap and a CNN with basic image manipulation was used to embed the artificial licensed plates in to realistic contexts. The trained model was then validated on real images captured from a parking lot and a publicly available traffic monitoring video stream. The results of experiments suggest detection accuracy of about 95% and an average running time of 40 milliseconds."

We propose a novel GAN-based active terrain mapping (GAN-ATM) algorithm which integrates Active Learning (AL) strategy into Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to build the terrain map efficiently with a very limited number of labeled data. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest predictive accuracy of 90.35%. Due to a more accurate terrain map, the UAV using GAN-ATM can plan the shortest trajectory among all existing counterparts."
