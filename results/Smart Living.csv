10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125712,CityTFT: A temporal fusion transformer-based surrogate model for urban building energy modeling,Dai T.Y.,"Almost one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions are from buildings and nearly 70 % of energy is consumed in urban areas. To address this as a long-term issue, accurately predicting building energy use at the urban level is indispensable. Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is an emerging method to investigate urban design and energy systems at urban and neighborhood levels. UBEM methods are considered reasonably accurate in simulating the performance of almost any building combinations. However, customized urban projects, and optimization problems involving many UBEM scenarios, are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and based on the scalability, the simulation runtime can be exponentially high if a broad set of design variations is analyzed.","Here, we propose a data-driven approach to generate a surrogate model for UBEM and accelerate the simulation process. Based on the extensively used forecasting model, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), we extract the static covariate encoder and variable selection network from the TFT structure while adding a small neural network to model the probability of triggering heating and cooling needs. The major advantages compared to other surrogate models are: (i) A sequential input in the transformer-based model to improve the temporal accuracy. (ii) A physics-inspired training strategy that builds on weather dynamics and urban interactions for hourly energy demands concurrently with a customized loss function. (iii) Improved generalizability for the proposed surrogate model using open and public data. In our study of 114 buildings in different climate zones in the US, our model predicts heating and cooling triggers in unseen climate dynamics with an F1 score of 0.83 while the root mean squared error (RMSE) of hourly loads was 71.51 kWh. This model is available for interfacing with climate projections and city-scale analysis as part of atmospheric urban digital twins."

10.1016/j.aej.2025.02.035,MiM-UNet: An efficient building image segmentation network integrating state space models,Liu D.,"With the advancement of remote sensing technology, the analysis of complex terrain images has become crucial for urban planning and geographic information extraction. However, existing models face significant challenges in processing intricate building structures: Transformer-based models suffer from high computational complexity and memory demands, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often struggle to capture features across multiple scales and hierarchical levels.","To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture, Mamba-in-Mamba U-Net (MiM-UNet), which integrates the design principles of state–space models (SSMs) to enhance both computational efficiency and feature extraction capacity. Specifically, MiM-UNet refines the traditional encoder–decoder framework by introducing Mamba-in-Mamba blocks, enabling precise multi-scale feature capture and efficient information fusion.

10.3390/buildings15050695,Building Change Detection in Aerial Imagery Using End-to-End Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation Techniques,Teo T.A.,"Automatic building change detection is essential for updating geospatial data, urban planning, and land use management.","The objective of this study is to propose a transformer-based UNet-like framework for end-to-end building change detection, integrating multi-temporal and multi-source data to improve efficiency and accuracy. Unlike conventional methods that focus on either spectral imagery or digital surface models (DSMs), the proposed method combines RGB color imagery, DSMs, and building vector maps in a three-branch Siamese architecture to enhance spatial, spectral, and elevation-based feature extraction. We chose Hsinchu, Taiwan as the experimental site and used 1:1000 digital topographic maps and airborne imagery from 2017, 2020, and 2023. The experimental results demonstrated that the data fusion model significantly outperforms other data combinations, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in detecting building changes. The RGB images provide spectral and texture details, DSMs offer structural and elevation context, and the building vector map enhances semantic consistency. This research advances building change detection by introducing a fully transformer-based model for end-to-end change detection, incorporating diverse geospatial data sources, and improving accuracy over traditional CNN-based methods.

10.11999/JEIT240720,Building Change Detection Data Generation Technology for Multi-temporal Remote Sensing Imagery Based on Consistent Generative Adversarial,Chen H.,"Objective Building change detection is an essential task in urban planning, disaster management, environmental monitoring, and other critical applications. Advances in multi-temporal remote sensing technology have provided vast amounts of data, enabling the monitoring of changes over large geographic areas and extended time frames. Despite this, significant challenges persist, particularly in acquiring sufficient labeled data pairs for training deep learning models. Building changes are typically characterized by long temporal cycles, leading to a scarcity of annotated data that is critical for training data-driven deep learning models. This scarcity severely limits the models’ capacity to generalize and achieve high accuracy, particularly in complex and diverse scenarios. The performance of existing methods often suffers from poor generalization due to insufficient training data, reducing their applicability to practical tasks.","To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel solution: the development of a multi-temporal building change detection data pair generation network, referred to as BAG-GAN. This network leverages a consistency adversarial generation mechanism to create diverse and semantically consistent data pairs. The aim is to enrich training datasets, thereby enhancing the learning capacity of deep learning models for detecting building changes. By addressing the bottleneck of insufficient labeled data, BAG-GAN provides a new pathway for improving the accuracy and robustness of multi-temporal building change detection. Methods BAG-GAN integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a specially designed consistency constraint mechanism, tailored for the generation of data pairs in multi-temporal building change detection tasks. The core innovation of this network lies in its adversarial consistency loss function. This loss function ensures that the generated images maintain semantic consistency with the corresponding input images while reflecting realistic and diverse changes. The consistency constraint is crucial for preserving the integrity of the generated data and ensuring its relevance to real-world scenarios. The network is composed of two main components: a generator and a discriminator, which work in tandem through an adversarial learning process. The generator aims to produce realistic and semantically consistent multi-temporal image pairs, while the discriminator evaluates the quality of the generated data, guiding the generator to improve iteratively. Additionally, BAG-GAN is equipped with multimodal output capabilities, enabling the generation of diverse building change data pairs. This diversity enhances the robustness of deep learning models by exposing them to a wider range of scenarios during training. To address the issue of limited training data, the study incorporates a data augmentation strategy. Original datasets, such as LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD, were reorganized by combining change labels with multi-temporal remote sensing images to create new synthetic datasets. These augmented datasets, along with the data generated by BAG-GAN, were used to train and evaluate several widely recognized deep learning models, including FC-EF, FC-Siam-Conc, and others. Comparative experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of BAG-GAN and its contribution to improving model performance in multi-temporal building change detection. Results and Discussions The experimental results demonstrate that BAG-GAN effectively addresses the challenges of insufficient labeled data in building change detection tasks. Models trained on the augmented datasets, which included BAG-GAN-generated data, achieved significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. For instance, classic models like FC-EF and FC-Siam-Conc showed substantial performance gains when trained on augmented datasets compared to their performance on the original datasets. These improvements validate the effectiveness of BAG-GAN in generating high-quality training data. BAG-GAN also excelled in producing diverse and multimodal building change data pairs visual comparisons between the generated data and the original datasets and highlighted the network’s ability to create realistic and varied data, effectively enhancing the diversity of training datasets. This diversity is critical for addressing the imbalance in existing datasets, where effective building change information is underrepresented. By increasing the proportion of relevant change information in the training data, BAG-GAN improves the learning conditions for deep learning models, enabling them to better generalize across different scenarios. Further analysis revealed that BAG-GAN significantly enhances the ability of detection models to localize changes and recover fine-grained details of building modifications. This is particularly evident in complex scenarios involving subtle or small-scale changes. The adversarial consistency loss function played a pivotal role in ensuring the semantic relevance of the generated data, making BAG-GAN a reliable tool for data augmentation in remote sensing applications. Moreover, the network’s ability to generate data pairs with high-quality and multimodal characteristics ensures its applicability to a wide range of remote sensing tasks beyond building change detection. Conclusions This study introduces BAG-GAN, a novel multi-temporal building change detection data pair generation network designed to overcome the limitations of insufficient labeled data in remote sensing. The network incorporates an adversarial consistency loss function, which ensures that the generated data is both semantically consistent and diverse. By leveraging a consistency adversarial generation mechanism, BAG-GAN enhances the quality and diversity of training datasets, addressing key bottlenecks in multi-temporal building change detection tasks. Through experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets, BAG-GAN demonstrated its ability to significantly improve the performance of classic remote sensing change detection models, such as FC-EF and FC-Siam-Conc. The results highlight the network’s effectiveness in generating high-quality data pairs that enhance model training and detection accuracy. This research not only provides a robust methodological framework for improving multi-temporal building change detection but also offers a foundational tool for broader applications in remote sensing. The findings pave the way for future advancements in change detection techniques, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field."

Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features.","Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs."

In the developed AI agent-based intelligent digital twin (I-DT), UBEM overcomes the limitations of the traditional UBEM approach and enables efficient analysis of urban building energy. GPT-based UBEM effectively performed the core functions of UBEM, serving as a key technology in I-UDT applications and services. What are the implications of the main findings? The I-UDT enables more accurate and comprehensive urban energy management, supporting the development of sustainable cities and carbon-neutral strategies. Implementing I-UDTs enables urban policymakers to make data-driven decisions, improve energy efficiency, and enhance the scalability of digital twin applications. The concept of digital twins (DTs) has expanded to encompass buildings and cities, with urban building energy modeling (UBEM) playing a crucial role in predicting urban-scale energy consumption via modeling individual energy use and interactions. As a virtual model within urban digital twins (UDTs), UBEM offers the potential for managing energy in sustainable cities. However, UDTs face challenges with regard to integrating large-scale data and relying on bottom-up UBEM approaches.","In this study, we propose an AI agent-based intelligent urban digital twin (I-UDT) to enhance DTs’ technical realization and UBEM’s service functionality. Integrating GPT within the UDT enabled the efficient integration of fragmented city-scale data and the extraction of building features, addressing the limitations of the service realization of traditional UBEM. This framework ensures continuous updates of the virtual urban model and the streamlined provision of updated information to users in future studies. This research establishes the concept of an I-UDT and lays a foundation for future implementations. The case studies include (1) data analysis, (2) prediction, (3) feature engineering, and (4) information services for 3500 buildings in Seoul. Through these case studies, the I-UDT was integrated and analyzed scattered data, predicted energy consumption, derived conditioned areas, and evaluated buildings on benchmark."

In practical applications, the constraints of observation trajectories frequently lead to the acquisition of a limited dataset of sparse SAR images, presenting challenges for TomoSAR 3D Reconstruction and affecting its signal-to-noise ratio and elevation resolution performance.","The study introduces a cascade adversarial strategy based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), optimised explicitly for sparse observation trajectories. In the preliminary phase of the CGAN, the U-Net architecture was employed to capture more global information and enhance image detail recovery capability, which is subsequently utilised in the cascade refinement network. The ResNet34 residual network in the advanced network stage was adopted to bolster feature extraction and image generation capabilities further. Based on experimental validation performed on the curated TomoSAR 3D super-resolution dataset tailored for buildings, the findings reveal that the methodology yields a notable enhancement in image quality and accuracy compared to other techniques."
10.1016/j.scs.2024.106048,Forecasting land surface drought in urban environments based on machine learning model,Chen J.,"Urban drought, a subtype of socio-economic drought, has received limited attention compared to other types. Given the shifts in water supply patterns due to global climate change and ongoing urbanization, understanding and predicting how urban design affects drought is crucial for sustainable human settlements. Previous research has primarily focused on large-scale predictive modeling, making it difficult for architects and urban designers to address potential drought risks.","This study addresses that issue by proposing an urban planning prediction model based on generative adversarial networks that integrates temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) maps. The model is trained on relevant datasets by using Guangzhou as a case study, including land cover, land surface temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index data. TVDI maps are generated from untrained image pairs based on urban planning parameters. Model validation, including accuracy analysis and scenario simulations, is conducted to assess the model's ability to predict urban land surface drought resulting from changes in urban planning. This approach highlights its proactive capacity to anticipate and reveal long-term or gradually unfolding drought trends, offering valid tools for urban design and planning."

A pre-trained object detection model i.e., Grounding DINO, is implemented to efficiently identify buildings. A novel manually labeled training data of detected buildings corresponding to their usage is used to extract features from building facades across diverse Indian cities (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi) using Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Following this, CLIPSeg a pre-trained segmentation model is used to recognizes text specifically on building elements like signs, posters, and banners. We then leverage GPT-3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), fine-tuned with a specifically designed few-shot prompting method, to infer building usage from the recognized text. To achieve optimal performance, the proposed ensemble linear metaclassifier combines predictions from ViT and LLM model. The predicted building usages are attributed to their corresponding locations to develop spatial maps. An analysis of our framework compared against ground truth data collected from various Indian cities reveals significantly accurate outcomes. Our findings highlight the utility of textual information in classifying utilities and commercial buildings, while features extracted from vision models prove more informative for residential buildings. Our approach can automate the generation of roadside building attributes and usage details on a larger scale."

The paper argues that an understanding of far-right spatiality will be limited without a more inter-scalar, relational and material framing of the various components of far-right world-building. Assemblage ontologies, seen through comparative cases, therefore hold value in making sense of the far-right today. Explorations of how digital media and the far-right are entangled with and co-producing built environments, are thus vital. As ideologies and philosophies (e.g., nationalism or conspiracism) travel across networked medias, complex hybridizations become infrastructurally-fixed-in-place. These affixations produce, and are produced by, geographical communities (e.g., urban developments). Far-right material infrastructures thereby extend from, and into, the digital, mediated by both human and nonhuman processes (such as generative AI), thus becoming co-constitutive elements of place, via land ownership, buildings, aesthetics, social encounters and practices, urban planning processes, and electoral politics; e.g., the assembled spatialities of everyday life. The paper juxtaposes two international cases, drawn from ethnography and critical discourse/visual analyses. The first is the territorialisation of circulating notions of American hyper-patriotic nationalism in the suburban South via urban developments and recreational spaces. The second case explores how far-right representations of conspiracism and debates around urban traditionalism versus modernity, are contested online and offline in Dresden, Saxony. Both cases point to the powerful entanglements of far-right ideology, digital media, and place. Conceptually, the paper juxtaposes phenomenological notions of far-right space/place with ideas of ‘strategic assemblage’ and online/offline ‘code space’, as ontological lenses to interrogate the relationships between far-right online worlds and the material configurations of physical infrastructures and materials which have troubling implications for everyday environments and democratic life.","This paper explores some ways that far-right worldviews are digitally encoded and strategically-assembled in and through built environments.

10.3390/app14188345,Geovisualization of Buildings: AI vs. Procedural Modeling,Nikçi R.,"Procedural modeling offers significant advantages over traditional methods of geovisualizing 3D building models, particularly in its use of scripts or machine language for model description.","This approach is highly suitable for computer processing and allows for the rapid rendering of entire building models and cities, especially when the buildings are not highly diverse, thus fully leveraging the strengths of procedural modeling. The first hypothesis is that buildings in the real world are mostly different and they should still be able to be displayed through procedural modeling procedures, and the second hypothesis is that this can be achieved in several ways. The first hypothesis suggests that real-world buildings, despite their diversity, can still be effectively represented through procedural modeling. The second hypothesis explores various methods to achieve this representation. The first approach involves recognizing the basic characteristics of a building from photographs and creating a model using machine learning. The second approach utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate detailed building models based on comprehensive input data. A script is generated for each building, making reverse procedural modeling in combination with AI an intriguing field of study, which is explored in this research. To validate this method, we compare AI-generated building models with manually derived models created through traditional procedural modeling techniques. The research demonstrates that integrating AI and machine learning techniques with procedural modeling significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of generating 3D building models. Specifically, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-to-geometry translation, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture generation, showed promising results in creating detailed and realistic 3D structures. This research is significant as it introduces a novel methodology that bridges the gap between traditional procedural modeling and modern AI-driven techniques. It offers a robust solution for automated 3D building modeling, potentially revolutionizing the fields of urban planning and architectural design by enabling more efficient and accurate digital representations of complex building geometries."

We developed and implemented a spatial modeling approach that disaggregates the senior household counts obtained from the U.S. Census block data to residential land parcels. This innovative method models the senior household count on each land parcel, generating a detailed, reliable synthetic microspatial dataset for urban senior studies.","Robust spatial analysis techniques are then applied to examine senior household spatial distribution in the context of segregation and access vulnerability in the study area. Our research, conducted in the urban setting of Colorado Springs, provides a deeper understanding of the senior residential landscape and identifies vulnerability. Our research findings are not just academic but also practical tools for planners, policymakers, and community advocates in the city to understand senior residential settlements, segregation, and social inequality. Our adaptable approach can be applied using similar modeling and analysis techniques for different study areas. The synthetic data and its generation approach are valuable resources for future urban senior research, enabling further examinations of different senior residential neighborhood typologies beyond basic demographic and socioeconomic aggregated indicators. They can assist studies interested in analyzing the influence of local factors and neighborhood effects on active aging among individuals, as well as simulating individual senior choices and spatial behaviors. Furthermore, they serve as a comparison baseline for future attempts to develop synthetic senior population data with socioeconomic and health characteristics."

However, it has also raised concerns amongst researchers over the past decade.","In this paper, we present an image-based urban road network generation framework using conditional diffusion models. We first trained a diffusion model capable of generating road images with similar characteristics to the ground truth using four context factors. Then, we used the trained model as the generator to synthesize road images conditioned in a geospatial context. Finally, we converted the generated road images into road networks with several post-processes. The experiments conducted in five cities of the United States showed that our model can generate reasonable road networks, maintaining the layouts and styles of real examples. Moreover, our model has the ability to show the obstructive effect of geographic barriers on urban roads. By comparing models with different context factors as input, we find that the model that considers all four factors generally performs the best. The most important factor in guiding the shape of road networks is intersections, implying that the development of urban roads is not only restricted by the natural environment but is more strongly influenced by human design."

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly utilized for this purpose, their effectiveness is constrained by limitations in capturing long-range relationships and contextual details due to the localized nature of convolution operations.","This study introduces the masked-attention mask transformer (Mask2Former), based on the Swin Transformer, for building footprint extraction from large-scale satellite imagery. To enhance the capture of large-scale semantic information and extract multiscale features, a hierarchical vision transformer with shifted windows (Swin Transformer) serves as the backbone network.

10.1007/978-981-97-4844-0_69,Generation of Building Plans Using ML and AI,Dasari A.,"Designing residential plans requires expertise and time. Traditional methods are prone to errors and are time-consuming. As a result, deep learning-based methods gained popularity in recent years.","This research paper proposes a novel approach to generating building and residential plans using VAE and GANs. The project started with a VAE with Dall-e, which imposed more constraints on the output image. However, this led to pixelated images that were difficult to interpret. To overcome this, GANs were used, which required fewer constraints to produce more explicit output images. In GANs, two networks are trained simultaneously, a generator network that produces new samples and a discriminator network that evaluates the quality of the generated samples. Through adversarial training, the generator network learns to produce images that resemble the actual samples. The proposed GAN approach can overpower traditional residential plan design methods, producing accurate and high-resolution plans that are easier to interpret. However, using GANs is challenging, with instability in the training process leading to mode collapse or gradient vanishing. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the potential of deep learning-based methods for generating building or residential plans. The proposed approach using VAE and GANs can reduce the effort and time required to design a residential project, making it a valuable tool for architects and urban planners. However, further research is needed to address the challenges associated with GANs and improve the model's performance."

To address the intricate nature of transportation issues, many researchers and planners have analyzed the complexities of urban and regional road systems using transportation models by employing transportation indices such as road length, network density, accessibility, and connectivity metrics.","This study addresses the complexities of predicting road network density for small and medium-sized Indian cities that come under the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) project at a national level. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and the CityGAN model is introduced to predict network density using spatial indicators of human settlements. The major goal of this study is to generate hyper-realistic urban patterns of small and medium-sized Indian cities using an unsupervised CityGAN model and to study the causal relationship between human settlement indices (HSIs) and transportation index (network density) using supervised KRR for the real cities. The synthetic urban universes mimic Indian urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through the settlement indices can aid in comprehending urban landscape, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. We analyzed 503 real cities to find the actual relationship between the urban settlements and their road density. The nonlinear KRR model may help urban planners in deriving the network density for GAN-generated futuristic urban patterns through the settlement indicators. The proposed hybrid process, termed as RidgeGAN model, can gauge the sustainability of urban sprawl tied to infrastructure and transportation systems in sprawling cities. Analysis results clearly demonstrate the utility of RidgeGAN in predicting network density for different kinds of human settlements, particularly for small and medium Indian cities. By predicting future urban patterns, this study can help in the creation of more livable and sustainable areas, particularly by improving transportation infrastructure in developing cities."

However, in regions where earthquakes do not occur frequently, model construction may be difficult due to a lack of training data. To address this issue, there is a need for technology that can generate earthquake scenarios for response training at any location. We proposed a model for generating earthquake scenarios using an auxiliary classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN)-based data synthesis. The proposed ACGAN model generates various earthquake scenarios by incorporating an auxiliary classifier learning process into the discriminator of GAN. Our results at borehole sensors showed that the seismic data generated by the proposed model had similar characteristics to actual data. To further validate our results, we compared the generated IM (such as PGA, PGV, and SA) with Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPE). Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of using the generated scenarios for earthquake early warning training. The proposed model and algorithm have significant potential in advancing seismic analysis and detection management systems, and also contribute to disaster management.","Effective response strategies to earthquake disasters are crucial for disaster management in smart cities.

Among the various basic units carrying urban functions, residential community plays a vital part for supporting human life. Therefore, the layout planning of residential community has always been of concern, and has attracted particular attention since the advent of deep learning that facilitates the automated layout generation and spatial pattern recognition.","However, the research circles generally suffer from the insufficiency of residential community layout benchmark or high-quality datasets, which hampers the future exploration of data-driven methods for residential community layout planning. The lack of datasets is largely due to the difficulties of large-scale real-world residential data acquisition and long-term expert screening. In order to address the issues and advance a benchmark dataset for various intelligent spatial design and analysis applications in the development of smart city, we introduce Residential Community Layout Planning (ReCo) Dataset, which is the first and largest open-source vector dataset related to real-world community to date. ReCo Dataset is presented in multiple data formats with 37,646 residential community layout plans, covering 598,728 residential buildings with height information. ReCo can be conveniently adapted for residential community layout related urban design tasks, e.g., generative layout design, morphological pattern recognition and spatial evaluation. To validate the utility of ReCo in automated residential community layout planning, two Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generative models are further applied to the dataset. We expect ReCo Dataset to inspire more creative and practical work in intelligent design and beyond. The ReCo Dataset is published at: https://www.kaggle.com/fdudsde/reco-dataset and related code can be found at: \urlhttps://github.com/FDUDSDE/ReCo-Dataset."

However, the real-world human trajectory data tends to be limited by user privacy or device acquisition issues, leading to its insufficient quality to support the above applications. Hence, generating human trajectory data is a crucial but challenging task, which suffers from the following two critical challenges: 1) how to capture the user distribution in human trajectories (group view), and 2) how to model the complex mobility patterns of each user trajectory (individual view).","In this paper, we propose a novel human trajectories generator (named VOLUNTEER), consisting of a user VAE and a trajectory VAE, to address the above challenges. Specifically, in the user VAE, we propose to learn the user distribution with all human trajectories from a group view. In the trajectory VAE, from the individual view, we model the complex mobility patterns by decoupling travel time and dwell time to accurately simulate individual trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art baselines. Further application analysis in the industrial system also demonstrates the effectiveness of our model."

However, data storage security is crucial. Moreover, we suggest a GAN-based network intrusion detection system (GAN–NIDS) that uses adversarial learning to assist the generator in learning the spatial distribution of normal network flows. The simulation results showed that the proposed eClusterGAN and GAN–NIDS outperformed the benchmarks in terms of clustering accuracy, running time, precision, recall, and F1, which can support researchers in studying economic data trends.

Providing a supportive built environment with reasonable amenities distribution for them is becoming more important. Previous GIS-based approaches to urban planning for this issue tend to be subjective with high labour costs.,"This paper uses the generative adversarial network (GAN) to explore the relationship between amenities distributions and urban morphology, thus effectively predicting and visualizing the ideal amenities distributions in fastgrowing cities based on the condition of well-developed megacities. In this research, we take Shanghai, one of the global cities in China with a big labour market, as the research sample. First, we use the Point of Interest (POI) data to draw the heatmap of urban amenities that support workers’ daily life and collect the corresponding city maps. Then, we cut them into hundreds of image pairs as the training set and train a GAN model for predicting the future amenities distributions in other cities. To implement the model, we further collect the city maps of Jiaxing, one of the second-tier cities near Shanghai, as the testing set. Results show that our trained model can accurately predict amenities distributions for its future. The GAN-based prediction could effectively support detailed urban planning."

By differentiating between these two types of points, the model can effectively capture mobility intentions and moving paths. The stopping point sequence generator utilizes a GAN-based approach to capture mobility intentions and patterns, while the moving point generator constructs a weighted directed road network graph to determine efficient paths between stopping points. Extensive experiments using a real-life mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in generating realistic trajectories. Moreover, when used for next location prediction task, the synthetic trajectory data generated by our model produces results that closely resemble real-world situations."

Existing methods to assess the solar potential of building facades often neglect the characteristics of individual facades.","This study presents an image-based method for a more accurate estimation of the PV potential of facades. The proposed method is composed of four steps: (1) data acquisition, preprocessing, and manual labeling, (2) training a pixel-wise semantic image segmentation model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), (3) color content analysis of segmented images, and (4) estimating the annual solar energy potential. We apply the proposed workflow to several buildings in Zurich, Switzerland, and evaluate segmentation quality and resulting changes in façade surface utilization factors. In a comparative analysis between the widely used web-based solar potential assessment tools, Sonnenfassade, Global Solar Atlas and the simulation software Climate Studio, we demonstrate the downstream impact of surface utilization factors on resulting solar potentials. Considerable deviations in façade availability for BIPV deployments among the various tools as compared to our segmentation approach indicate the potential impact of the proposed method on policy-making and the benefits for BIPV design and planning."

Distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging infrastructure play a vital role in the planning and construction of smart cities. However, the uncertainty associated with the power output of distributed generation significantly impacts the planning of distribution networks.","To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability. Additionally, in terms of algorithm efficiency, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms tested in terms of the number of iterations and speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed planning model in improving the economy and stability of the distribution network.

This in turn makes using indoor space more compelling and leads to more energy consumption. Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities.","This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different façade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments. HIGHLIGHTS Machine learning use in outdoor thermal comfort assessment has been investigated. Vegetation, urban geometry, surface albedo, and water bodies have been studied parameters. Vegetation and street orientation have the highest and water bodies have the least impact on outdoor thermal comfort. Pix2pix algorithm implementation could create thermal comfort maps with 96% SSIM."

At the same time, the relationship between urban form and the COVID-19 epidemic is established, so that the machine can automatically deduce and calculate the appearance of urban forms that are prone to epidemics and may have high risks, which has application value and potential in the field of planning and design. In this study, taking Macau as an example, this method was used to conduct model training, image generation, and comparison of the derivation results of different assumed epidemic distribution degrees. The implications of this study for urban planning are as follows: (1) there is a correlation between different urban forms and the distribution of epidemics, and CGAN can be used to predict urban forms with high epidemic risk; (2) large-scale buildings and high-density buildings can promote the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; (3) green public open spaces and squares have an inhibitory effect on the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; and (4) reducing the volume and density of buildings and increasing the area of green public open spaces and squares can help reduce the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic."

Currently, performance-based urban and building design relies on a time-consuming numerical simulation process, hindering performance optimization early in the design process.","This paper proposes an automated design process that applies generative adversarial network (GAN) as a surrogate model to accelerate environmental performance-driven urban design. Parameterized urban blocks are designed for random sampling and constructing a numerical simulation database. The GAN model was trained to predict pedestrian level wind (PLW), annual cumulative solar radiation (Radiation) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in real-time. The GAN-based surrogate model is combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve real-time optimization of urban morphology. The results show that on the test set, the pix2pix model using a specific encoding method predicts the R2 of 0.70, 0.86 and 0.80 for PLW, Radiation and UTCI, respectively, while the method can speed up 120–240 times compared to the numerical simulation method.

This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines. We also showcase that TrafficGAN can identify potential traffic issues in some regions and suggest possible reasons."

The building morphology and blocks constitute the simulation cases and are simulated considering seven cities in four thermal climate zones. The climate characteristic parameters and geographic location information of the cities are used as the input for the simulation to obtain a regression model that can be applied in most areas of China to predict the shading effect. Grasshopper and EnergyPlus were used to develop the physical models and estimate the building loads for stand-alone buildings or buildings in a network. The results demonstrate that the influence of shading varies significantly under different scenarios, and cooling loads can be over-estimated up to 45% and heating load under-estimated up to 21% in some cities such as Lanzhou. Using the distribution range of 95% relative errors to evaluate the reliability and generalization of the model, the results show that the established support vector regression can effectively calculate the shading effect. The proposed method can quickly estimate the building energy demand by considering the shading effect, which is expected to provide technical support for urban design and energy planning."

However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy.","GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia).

We show that unlimited quantities of realistic data can be automatically generated, including data for different scenarios, and that it can be used by Machine Learning to discover the underlying correlations."

An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured 3D virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include thin clouds, which degrade image quality.","In this research, the thin clouds in these aerial photographs are removed by using a generative adversarial network, which leads to improvements in training accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a method for automatically generating building mask images by using 3D virtual models with textured aerial photographs to enable the removable of thin clouds so that the image can be used for deep learning. A model trained on datasets generated by the proposed method was able to detect buildings in aerial photographs with an accuracy of IoU = 0.651."
