10.1016/j.landurbplan.2025.105365,A hybrid framework for regional land valuation using generative intelligence and AutoML techniques,Jiang F.,"Land value is a crucial indicator of economic dynamics and regional development, providing essential information for urban planning and policy development. However, most existing studies estimate a singular land value over large areas, lacking the fine-grained details for urban management.","This study therefore develops a RAHGV (relative-to-absolute hybrid generative valuation) framework for regional land valuation, which combines a hybrid learning strategy with deep generative modeling to produce high-resolution, spatially continuous land value distribution across extensive urban areas. In a case study of New York City (NYC), the RAHGV model outperforms typical one-step models by differentiating between local land variations and broader regional tendencies. Its bi-attention bottleneck significantly improves model performance, reducing MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 45.75% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) by 69.86% compared to conventional deep generative methods. Local physical infrastructure and mixed land-use patterns primarily influence micro-scale land values, while community amenities and economic vibrancy drive macro-scale values. The findings highlight the potential of the RAHGV framework as a powerful tool for promoting sustainable urban development by delivering high-resolution, data-driven insights that support informed decision-making in rapidly evolving urban environments."
10.1016/j.landusepol.2025.107535,A green infrastructure planning approach for enhanced flood control and resilience in urban areas,Rahman M.R.,Urban flooding presents a growing challenge in metropolitan areas due to climate change and increasing impervious surfaces.,"This research proposes a Green Infrastructure (GI) planning approach to enhance flood control and resilience in the flood-prone Yeoksam-dong region of Gangnam, Seoul, South Korea. A mixed-method approach was employed, incorporating both residents’ preferences and hydrological simulations using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to assess the effectiveness of various GI controls. Key GI co-benefits were identified through importance–performance analysis (IPA) and fuzzy weight rankings. Based on these, three GI scenarios were developed and evaluated for their flood mitigation potential. Scenario 1 (infiltration trench, rain garden, and rain barrel) emerged as the most effective, reducing surface runoff by 18.56 % and achieving the best cost-benefit ratio of 1.01 over a 10-year period. Scenario 2 (bio-retention, pervious pavement, and green roof), while less effective in terms of flood mitigation, may still offer ecological and social co-benefits. The study also conducted a sensitivity analysis, which confirmed Scenario 1’s robustness across various levels of imperviousness, making it a highly adaptable solution for urban settings. This research highlights the importance of community engagement in GI planning and demonstrates how integrating hydrological performance with socioeconomic benefits can enhance urban resilience. By aligning with the 4Rs of resilience; robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners seeking cost-effective, scalable solutions for flood-prone areas. The findings underscore the value of multifunctional GI controls in not only reducing flood risks but also promoting long-term sustainability and community well-being."

Unlike traditional networks, 5G networks feature higher connection density, faster data transmission speeds, and lower latency, which are widely applied in scenarios such as smart cities, the Internet of Things, and autonomous driving. The vast amounts of sensitive data generated by these applications become primary targets during the processes of collection and secure sharing, and unauthorized access or tampering could lead to severe data breaches and integrity issues. However, as 5G networks extensively employ encryption technologies to protect data transmission, attackers can hide malicious content within encrypted communication, rendering traditional content-based traffic detection methods ineffective for identifying malicious encrypted traffic.","To address this challenge, this paper proposes a malicious encrypted traffic detection method based on reconstructive domain adaptation and adversarial hybrid neural networks. The proposed method integrates generative adversarial networks with ResNet, ResNeXt, and DenseNet to construct an adversarial hybrid neural network, aiming to tackle the challenges of encrypted traffic detection.

We focus on early-stage urban design, where sketching is a common tool and the design starts from balancing building volumes (masses) and open spaces. With Human-Centered AI in mind, we aim to help architects quickly revise their ideas by easily switching between 2D sketches and 3D models, allowing for smoother iteration and sharing of ideas.

We focus on early-stage urban design, where sketching is a common tool and the design starts from balancing building volumes (masses) and open spaces. With Human-Centered AI in mind, we aim to help architects quickly revise their ideas by easily switching between 2D sketches and 3D models, allowing for smoother iteration and sharing of ideas. Inspired by feedback from architects and existing workflows, our system takes as a first input a user sketch of multiple buildings in a top-down view. The user then draws a perspective sketch of the envisioned site. Our method is designed to exploit the complementarity of information in the two sketches and allows users to quickly preview and adjust the inferred 3D shapes. Our model has two main components.

A pre-trained object detection model i.e., Grounding DINO, is implemented to efficiently identify buildings. A novel manually labeled training data of detected buildings corresponding to their usage is used to extract features from building facades across diverse Indian cities (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi) using Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Following this, CLIPSeg a pre-trained segmentation model is used to recognizes text specifically on building elements like signs, posters, and banners. We then leverage GPT-3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), fine-tuned with a specifically designed few-shot prompting method, to infer building usage from the recognized text. To achieve optimal performance, the proposed ensemble linear metaclassifier combines predictions from ViT and LLM model. The predicted building usages are attributed to their corresponding locations to develop spatial maps. An analysis of our framework compared against ground truth data collected from various Indian cities reveals significantly accurate outcomes. Our findings highlight the utility of textual information in classifying utilities and commercial buildings, while features extracted from vision models prove more informative for residential buildings. Our approach can automate the generation of roadside building attributes and usage details on a larger scale."

Effectively addressing this spatial complexity necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, as unified methodologies may prove insufficient. Specifically, in urban planning, it is increasingly crucial to prioritize bike lanes, bike stations, and pedestrian zones, for functional transportation infrastructures.","This approach can enhance cities by improving air quality, reducing emissions, and boosting public health and safety through physical activity and accident prevention. However, implementing these changes requires careful planning, community engagement, and stakeholder collaboration. This paper proposes a hybrid model for identifying optimal locations for bike lanes, bike stations, and pedestrian zones adopting Real-Time Spatial Delphi and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Nevertheless, these judgments are a spatial representation not visible in reality, and with the spread of artificial intelligence models, different implementations can support the planning process, such as the use of GANs. In this case, GANs can be exploited by adopting pre-existing location images resulting from experts’ judgments to illustrate the proposed intervention’s visual impact. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid model, we apply it to the city of Dublin.

Current road networks, especially in large cities, face acute pressures due to increased demand for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Although much attention has been given to improve traffic management and accommodate the increased demand via coordinating and optimizing traffic signals, research focused on adapting the static allocation of street spaces and right-of-way dynamically based on mixed traffic flow is still scarce.","This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) agent approach that cooperatively adapts the individual lane widths and right-of-way access permissions based on real-world mixed traffic flow. In particular, multiple cooperative agents are trained with mixed temporal data that learn to decide suitable lane widths for motorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, along with whether co-sharing space between pedestrians and cyclists is safe. Using a microscopic traffic simulator model of a four-legged intersection, we trained our RL agent on synthetic data, and tested it on realistic multi-modal traffic data. The proposed approach reduces the overall average waiting time and queue length by 48.9% and 37.7%, respectively, compared to the Static (baseline) street design. Additionally, we observe CALM's ability to gradually adjust lane widths, contrasting with the Heuristic implementation's erratic lane adjustments, which pose potential safety concerns. Notably, the model learns to adaptively toggle the co-sharing of street space between cyclists and pedestrians as one co-shared lane, ensuring comfort and maintaining the level of service according to the designer's policy. Finally, we demonstrate CALM's scalability on a simulated large-scale traffic network."

Among many tasks, urban layout is the foundation for urban regeneration.","In this paper, we target a new task called function-aware urban layout regeneration, and propose UrbanEvolver, a function-aware deep generative model for the task. Given a target region to be regenerated, our model outputs a regenerated urban layout (i.e., roads and buildings) for the target region by considering the function (i.e., land use type) of the target region and its surrounding context (i.e., the functions and urban layouts of the surrounding regions). UrbanEvolver first extracts implicit regeneration rules from the target function and the surrounding context by encoding them separately in different scales through the function-layout adaptive (FA) blocks, and then constrains the regenerated urban layout based on the learned regeneration rules.

It is equipped with a history-gated multimodal denoising network, i.e., HamNet, dedicated to the crime risk map inference. HamNet emphasizes the importance of historical crime data via a Gated-based History Fusion (GHF) module and adaptively controls multimodal conditions to be fused across different diffusion time steps via a Time step-Aware Modality Fusion (TAMF) module. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffCrime, which outperforms baselines by at least 43% and 31% in terms of RMSE, respectively."
10.1007/s11629-023-8390-1,Debris flow runout behaviors considering the influences of densely populated buildings,Zhang S.,"Debris flows pose serious risks to communities in mountainous areas, often resulting in large losses of human life and property. The impeding presence of urban buildings often affects the runout behavior and deposition of debris flows. But the impact of different building densities and sizes on debris flow dynamics has yet to be quantified to guide urban planning in debris flow risk zones.","This study focused on a debris flow that occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, China on August 7th, 2010, which was catastrophic and destroyed many buildings. The FLO-2D software was used to simulate this debris flow in two scenarios, i.e. the presence and the absence of buildings, to obtain debris-flow intensity parameters. The developed model was then used to further analyze the influence of large buildings and narrow channels within the urban environment. The simulation results show that considering the presence of buildings in the simulation is essential for accurate assessment of debris flow intensity and deposition distribution. The layout of buildings in the upstream urban area, such as large buildings or parallel buildings which form narrow channels, can affect the flow velocity and depth of debris flow heading towards downstream buildings. To mitigate damage to downstream buildings, the relative spacing (d/a) between upstream and downstream buildings should not exceed a value of two and should ideally be even lower. These findings provide valuable insights for improving the resistance of mountainous cities to urban debris flows."

Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes.","The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources. The results show that contextual feedback performed better overall, with significant improvements in the pragmatic and hedonic quality, attractiveness, reuse intention, feeling that the complaint is taken seriously, and the citizens' trust in their municipality."

In this context, the automatic generation of such maps with respect to certain requirements and constraints is an important task.","This paper presents a first step towards a deep automatic generation of figure-ground maps where the built density of the generated scenes is controlled and taken into account. This is preformed building upon a Geographic Data Translation model which has been applied to generate less available geospatial features, e.g. building footprints, from more widely available geospatial data, e.g. street network data, using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. A novel processing approach is introduced to incorporate the population density and the built density accordingly. Furthermore, the impact of both the level of detail of the street network, i.e. its sparsity or density, and the spatial resolution of the training data on the generated figure-ground maps has been investigated. The generated maps and the qualitative results reveal an obvious impact of these parameters on the layout of built and unbuilt areas. Our approach paves the way for the expansion of existing districts by figure-ground maps of future neighbourhoods considering factors such as density and further parameters which will be subject of future work."

However, it has also raised concerns amongst researchers over the past decade.","In this paper, we present an image-based urban road network generation framework using conditional diffusion models. We first trained a diffusion model capable of generating road images with similar characteristics to the ground truth using four context factors. Then, we used the trained model as the generator to synthesize road images conditioned in a geospatial context. Finally, we converted the generated road images into road networks with several post-processes. The experiments conducted in five cities of the United States showed that our model can generate reasonable road networks, maintaining the layouts and styles of real examples. Moreover, our model has the ability to show the obstructive effect of geographic barriers on urban roads. By comparing models with different context factors as input, we find that the model that considers all four factors generally performs the best. The most important factor in guiding the shape of road networks is intersections, implying that the development of urban roads is not only restricted by the natural environment but is more strongly influenced by human design."

10.3390/jimaging10050112,Day-to-Night Street View Image Generation for 24-Hour Urban Scene Auditing Using Generative AI,Liu Z.,"A smarter city should be a safer city. Nighttime safety in metropolitan areas has long been a global concern, particularly for large cities with diverse demographics and intricate urban forms, whose citizens are often threatened by higher street-level crime rates. However, due to the lack of night-time urban appearance data, prior studies based on street view imagery (SVI) rarely addressed the perceived night-time safety issue, which can generate important implications for crime prevention.","This study hypothesizes that night-time SVI can be effectively generated from widely existing daytime SVIs using generative AI (GenAI). To test the hypothesis, this study first collects pairwise day-and-night SVIs across four cities diverged in urban landscapes to construct a comprehensive day-and-night SVI dataset. It then trains and validates a day-to-night (D2N) model with fine-tuned brightness adjustment, effectively transforming daytime SVIs to nighttime ones for distinct urban forms tailored for urban scene perception studies. Our findings indicate that: (1) the performance of D2N transformation varies significantly by urban-scape variations related to urban density; (2) the proportion of building and sky views are important determinants of transformation accuracy; (3) within prevailed models, CycleGAN maintains the consistency of D2N scene conversion, but requires abundant data. Pix2Pix achieves considerable accuracy when pairwise day–and–night-night SVIs are available and are sensitive to data quality. StableDiffusion yields high-quality images with expensive training costs. Therefore, CycleGAN is most effective in balancing the accuracy, data requirement, and cost. This study contributes to urban scene studies by constructing a first-of-its-kind D2N dataset consisting of pairwise day-and-night SVIs across various urban forms. The D2N generator will provide a cornerstone for future urban studies that heavily utilize SVIs to audit urban environments."

Varanasi is proposed to be developed into a Smart City in the first phase of Indian Smart City Mission. The resilience of a city is its ability to persevere in the face of an emergency, so it can continue functioning despite serious challenges. Flood is a frequent phenomenon for Varanasi, but in recent years, it was deluged. The flood-risk zones mapping makes the first step of flood control measures.","In this chapter, a one-dimensional hydraulic model, i.e. HEC-RAS has been integrated with Remote sensing and GIS techniques to map the floodplain zones of Ganga River located around the city of Varanasi.

10.1109/ICFTSS61109.2024.10690268,Leveraging Trusted Input Framework to Correct and Forecast the Electricity Load in Smart City Zones Against Adversarial Attacks,Kamilin M.H.B.,"Recent cybersecurity research is shifting to favor adversarial attacks, which are harder to detect and counteract, as they are not apparent, and they exploit the vulnerability of the deployed machine learning model. With machine learning seeing wider adoption to forecast the electricity load in smart cities to help maintain grid stability and better integrate with renewable energies, the energy sector is at risk. Although several methods exist to mitigate the problem, adversarial training fails against the attack that utilizes a surrogate model. In addition, it cannot differentiate between the original and adversarial data without relying on adversarial detection. Furthermore, existing detections do not correct the data to keep the forecast running.","In this paper, the Multivariable Convolutional Encoder implementation in a Trusted Input Framework was proposed, which utilizes hidden input data with a high correlation to act as a trap when creating the surrogate model, measuring the attack intensity, and improve the accuracy to 'correct' and 'forecast' on the target data. In the experiment, the proposed method not only fooled the surrogate but also achieved a coefficient of determination score of 0.9183 on the most robust Projected Gradient Descent-based adversarial attack, which is 13.933% better than the adversarial training."
10.1007/978-981-97-4844-0_69,Generation of Building Plans Using ML and AI,Dasari A.,"Designing residential plans requires expertise and time. Traditional methods are prone to errors and are time-consuming. As a result, deep learning-based methods gained popularity in recent years.","This research paper proposes a novel approach to generating building and residential plans using VAE and GANs. The project started with a VAE with Dall-e, which imposed more constraints on the output image. However, this led to pixelated images that were difficult to interpret. To overcome this, GANs were used, which required fewer constraints to produce more explicit output images. In GANs, two networks are trained simultaneously, a generator network that produces new samples and a discriminator network that evaluates the quality of the generated samples. Through adversarial training, the generator network learns to produce images that resemble the actual samples. The proposed GAN approach can overpower traditional residential plan design methods, producing accurate and high-resolution plans that are easier to interpret. However, using GANs is challenging, with instability in the training process leading to mode collapse or gradient vanishing. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the potential of deep learning-based methods for generating building or residential plans. The proposed approach using VAE and GANs can reduce the effort and time required to design a residential project, making it a valuable tool for architects and urban planners. However, further research is needed to address the challenges associated with GANs and improve the model's performance."

Existing literature lacks both an examination of these biases and a solution.","This study identifies and quantifies these biases by comparing conventional SVI with views from the road shoulder/sidewalk. To mitigate such perspective biases, we introduce a novel framework with generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image generation models (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN), an image regression model (ResNet-50), and a tabular model (LightGBM). Experiments assessed model effectiveness in translating car-centric views to those from pedestrian and cyclist perspectives. Results show significant differences in semantic indicators (e.g. green view index) between road center and road shoulder/sidewalk SVI, with low Pearson’s correlation coefficients r (0.35–0.55 for road shoulders and 0.45–0.47 for sidewalks) indicating bias. The framework succeeded in creating realistic images and aligning pixel ratios between perspectives, achieving strong correlation coefficients (0.81 for road shoulders and 0.83 for sidewalks), thus reducing bias.

To address the intricate nature of transportation issues, many researchers and planners have analyzed the complexities of urban and regional road systems using transportation models by employing transportation indices such as road length, network density, accessibility, and connectivity metrics.","This study addresses the complexities of predicting road network density for small and medium-sized Indian cities that come under the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) project at a national level. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and the CityGAN model is introduced to predict network density using spatial indicators of human settlements. The major goal of this study is to generate hyper-realistic urban patterns of small and medium-sized Indian cities using an unsupervised CityGAN model and to study the causal relationship between human settlement indices (HSIs) and transportation index (network density) using supervised KRR for the real cities. The synthetic urban universes mimic Indian urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through the settlement indices can aid in comprehending urban landscape, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. We analyzed 503 real cities to find the actual relationship between the urban settlements and their road density. The nonlinear KRR model may help urban planners in deriving the network density for GAN-generated futuristic urban patterns through the settlement indicators. The proposed hybrid process, termed as RidgeGAN model, can gauge the sustainability of urban sprawl tied to infrastructure and transportation systems in sprawling cities. Analysis results clearly demonstrate the utility of RidgeGAN in predicting network density for different kinds of human settlements, particularly for small and medium Indian cities. By predicting future urban patterns, this study can help in the creation of more livable and sustainable areas, particularly by improving transportation infrastructure in developing cities."

To solve this problem, we first created a simulated virtual environment, where agents can move freely in a small part of a city, the harbor area in Hamburg, Germany. We assumed that happiness is a crucial motivating factor for the movement of citizens.

However, traditional urban planning is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Deep generative learning gives us hope that we can automate this planning process and come up with the ideal urban plans. While remarkable achievements have been obtained, they have exhibited limitations in lacking awareness of: 1) the hierarchical dependencies between functional zones and spatial grids; 2) the peer dependencies among functional zones; and 3) human regulations to ensure the usability of generated configurations.","To address these limitations, we develop a novel human-instructed deep hierarchical generative model. We rethink the urban planning generative task from a unique functionality perspective, where we summarize planning requirements into different functionality projections for better urban plan generation. To this end, we develop a three-stage generation process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function. The third stage is to leverage multi-attentions to model the zone-zone peer dependencies of the functionality projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."

In the industrial areas of smart city, the IoT focuses on industrial applications, such as logistics and environmental monitoring.","In this work, an auxiliary position analysis framework composed of IoT and distributed mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed to analyze the position of vehicles in the industrial areas of smart city. In the proposed framework, IoT are deployed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with uniform linear array (ULA), which receives the signal emitted by vehicles for obtaining the direction of arrival (DOA), and the distributed MEC provides computing and synchronization services to auxiliary positioning. The DOA estimation is a key issue for auxiliary positioning in the proposed framework. To realize DOA estimation with unknown mutual coupling (MC) existing in IoT nodes, a novel block sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is developed. In the developed algorithm, the unknown MC existing between sensors in each IoT nodes is first fused with the signal by parameterizing steering vector. Then, a block SBL (BSBL) procedure is presented to perform DOA estimation by using the inherent block sparse structure in the equivalent signal obtained after fusion. Benefiting from the fusion of MC and signal, the developed DOA estimation algorithm does not require a separate estimation of the unknown MC and also does not cause the loss of the array aperture. Based on the DOA estimation information, the position of vehicles in the industrial environment is effectively analyzed through weighted multiple cross-locations. Synthetic data set simulation is carried out to verify that the vehicle positions in smart city can be efficiently analyzed and estimated based on the presented framework and algorithm."

Providing a supportive built environment with reasonable amenities distribution for them is becoming more important. Previous GIS-based approaches to urban planning for this issue tend to be subjective with high labour costs.,"This paper uses the generative adversarial network (GAN) to explore the relationship between amenities distributions and urban morphology, thus effectively predicting and visualizing the ideal amenities distributions in fastgrowing cities based on the condition of well-developed megacities. In this research, we take Shanghai, one of the global cities in China with a big labour market, as the research sample. First, we use the Point of Interest (POI) data to draw the heatmap of urban amenities that support workers’ daily life and collect the corresponding city maps. Then, we cut them into hundreds of image pairs as the training set and train a GAN model for predicting the future amenities distributions in other cities. To implement the model, we further collect the city maps of Jiaxing, one of the second-tier cities near Shanghai, as the testing set. Results show that our trained model can accurately predict amenities distributions for its future. The GAN-based prediction could effectively support detailed urban planning."

Existing methods to assess the solar potential of building facades often neglect the characteristics of individual facades.","This study presents an image-based method for a more accurate estimation of the PV potential of facades. The proposed method is composed of four steps: (1) data acquisition, preprocessing, and manual labeling, (2) training a pixel-wise semantic image segmentation model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), (3) color content analysis of segmented images, and (4) estimating the annual solar energy potential. We apply the proposed workflow to several buildings in Zurich, Switzerland, and evaluate segmentation quality and resulting changes in façade surface utilization factors. In a comparative analysis between the widely used web-based solar potential assessment tools, Sonnenfassade, Global Solar Atlas and the simulation software Climate Studio, we demonstrate the downstream impact of surface utilization factors on resulting solar potentials. Considerable deviations in façade availability for BIPV deployments among the various tools as compared to our segmentation approach indicate the potential impact of the proposed method on policy-making and the benefits for BIPV design and planning."

Distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging infrastructure play a vital role in the planning and construction of smart cities. However, the uncertainty associated with the power output of distributed generation significantly impacts the planning of distribution networks.","To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability. Additionally, in terms of algorithm efficiency, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms tested in terms of the number of iterations and speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed planning model in improving the economy and stability of the distribution network. Furthermore, it enhances the computational efficiency of the planning problem associated with distributed power supply and electric vehicle charging stations.

But what data sets should training processes be based on if there is not yet a city from which to collect data, or if data is not usable due to privacy issues? Synthetic data can provide a realistic representation of conditions in the city not only for machine learning experts, but also for smart city experts. For data-affine users, there are machine learning-based methods for generating synthetic data, but these have limited accessibility to data amateurs. The Platform Data Fusion Generator (DaFne) project aims to improve the usability of data generation methods for various professions.

However, classical analysis methods cannot easily overcome data sparsity, and spatio-temporal adjoint relation discovery does not provide accurate results.","This paper proposes an interactive visual analysis system based on resident behavior data characteristics and visual analysis tasks. The system processes the original data, extracts the relevant spatio-temporal characteristics, and identifies the user's adjoint relations. Additionally, the system uses an improved variable sliding window algorithm combined with visual analysis technology to design a user relationship diagram, time Gantt chart, schematic map of multivariable representation, radial bar chart, calendar thermal chart, and others. Based on these visual tools, the traffic distribution, user origin, and other characteristics of the residence site can be visually analyzed in multiple periods. By performing case studies based on two real datasets, the behavior patterns and phenomena that prove the usability and extensibility of the proposed system are explained.

This in turn makes using indoor space more compelling and leads to more energy consumption. Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities.","This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different façade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments. HIGHLIGHTS Machine learning use in outdoor thermal comfort assessment has been investigated. Vegetation, urban geometry, surface albedo, and water bodies have been studied parameters.

10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00362-6,Scaling of urban amenities: generative statistics and implications for urban planning,Kaufmann T.,"Cities have been extensively studied as complex adaptive systems over the last 50 years. Recently, several empirical studies and emerging theory provided support for the fact that many different urban indicators follow general consistent statistical patterns across countries, cultures and times. In particular, total personal income, measures of innovation, crime rates, characteristics of the built environment and other indicators have been shown to exhibit non-linear power-law scaling with the population size of functional cities.","Here, we show how to apply this type of analysis inside cities to establish universal patterns in the quantity and distribution of urban amenities such as restaurants, parks, and universities. Using a unique data set containing millions of amenities in the 50 largest US metropolitan areas, we establish general non-linear scaling patterns between each city’s population and many different amenities types, the small-area statistics of their spatial abundance, and the characteristics of their mean distance to each other. We use these size-specific statistical findings to produce generative models for the expected amenity abundances of any US city. We then compute the deviations observed in given cities from this statistical many-amenity model to build a characteristic signature for each urban area. Finally, we show how urban planning can be guided by these systemic quantitative expectations in the context of new city design or the identification of local deficits in service provision in existing cities."

At the same time, the relationship between urban form and the COVID-19 epidemic is established, so that the machine can automatically deduce and calculate the appearance of urban forms that are prone to epidemics and may have high risks, which has application value and potential in the field of planning and design. In this study, taking Macau as an example, this method was used to conduct model training, image generation, and comparison of the derivation results of different assumed epidemic distribution degrees. The implications of this study for urban planning are as follows: (1) there is a correlation between different urban forms and the distribution of epidemics, and CGAN can be used to predict urban forms with high epidemic risk; (2) large-scale buildings and high-density buildings can promote the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; (3) green public open spaces and squares have an inhibitory effect on the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; and (4) reducing the volume and density of buildings and increasing the area of green public open spaces and squares can help reduce the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic."

Currently, performance-based urban and building design relies on a time-consuming numerical simulation process, hindering performance optimization early in the design process.","This paper proposes an automated design process that applies generative adversarial network (GAN) as a surrogate model to accelerate environmental performance-driven urban design. Parameterized urban blocks are designed for random sampling and constructing a numerical simulation database. The GAN model was trained to predict pedestrian level wind (PLW), annual cumulative solar radiation (Radiation) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in real-time. The GAN-based surrogate model is combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve real-time optimization of urban morphology. The results show that on the test set, the pix2pix model using a specific encoding method predicts the R2 of 0.70, 0.86 and 0.80 for PLW, Radiation and UTCI, respectively, while the method can speed up 120–240 times compared to the numerical simulation method. The optimization results show that NSGA-II combined with global averaging pooling achieves the best optimization results. When the number of optimized samples exceeds 174, the proposed method has a time advantage over traditional methods for outdoor environment optimization in urban design."
10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101852,Generative population synthesis for joint household and individual characteristics,Aemmer Z.,"Household surveys provide immense value in the fields of transportation and urban planning. However, even the most well-funded surveying agencies rely on sampling methods to estimate the nature of the true population, and the collected microdata is frequently aggregated, or limited in volume and detail to protect the privacy of respondents. Population synthesis provides a means to scale this microdata to represent larger regions for use in microsimulation. Despite their accuracy and widespread adoption, traditional synthesis algorithms for reweighting microdata samples scale poorly with the number of variables and geographic regions being modeled, and can suffer from non-convergence with smaller sample sizes. Several generative models have been proposed to address these shortcomings, but lack features such as sub-region modeling, and the ability to simultaneously generate both individuals and households.","This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4–16 variables). The VAE/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples."

Recent studies have shown that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have the potential to shed light on this task. However, existing GAN-based models are limited by the sparsity of urban data and instability in model training, hampering their applications.","Here, we propose a GAN framework with geographical knowledge, namely Metropolitan GAN (MetroGAN), for urban morphology simulation. We incorporate a progressive growing structure to learn hierarchical features and design a geographical loss to impose the constraints of water areas. Besides, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for the complex structure of urban systems. Results show that MetroGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art urban simulation methods by over 20% in all metrics. Inspiringly, using physical geography features singly, MetroGAN can still generate shapes of the cities. These results demonstrate that MetroGAN solves the instability problem of previous urban simulation GANs and is generalizable to deal with various urban attributes."

Removing air pollutants generated by various emission sources is crucial to control PM2.5, improve air quality, and maintain human health in high-density urban areas. In response to air pollution, urban vegetation plays an essential role in providing air quality regulation service.","To estimate the air quality regulation service provided by urban vegetation, this study integrated spatial analysis, a dry deposition model, and an atmospheric diffusion model to spatially quantify the air quality regulation service of PM2.5 in Taipei City on a high-resolution scale (30 m × 30 m per spatial unit). The results show that in 2016, total PM2.5 emissions in Taipei City were 1,400.88 tonnes and that urban vegetation removed 18.31 tonnes of PM2.5, with an average PM2.5 removal rate of 0.16 g/m2, and the corresponding PM2.5 concentration improvement value of 0.0136 μg/m3. This finding revealed a significant gap between the amounts of emissions and purifications of PM2.5, the air quality regulation service provided by the urban vegetation in Taipei City remains insufficient. The results of this study not only point out the spatial differences of regulation services and propose a new research framework for quantifying the natural benefits, but also as a guideline for governments to form the auxiliary policies of the urban ecosystem service and facilitate the urban green infrastructure planning."
10.1109/TBDATA.2020.3014511,Off-Deployment Traffic Estimation-A Traffic Generative Adversarial Networks Approach,Zhang Y.,"The rapid progress of urbanization has expedited the process of urban planning, e.g., new residential, commercial areas, which in turn boosts the local travel demand.","We propose a novel 'off-deployment traffic estimation problem', namely, to foresee the traffic condition changes of a region prior to the deployment of a construction plan. This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines. We also showcase that TrafficGAN can identify potential traffic issues in some regions and suggest possible reasons."
10.11897/SP.J.1016.2022.01133,Trajectory Prediction in Complex Scenes Based on Multi-Head Attention Adversarial Mechanism,Yu L.,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent city construction and public crisis management. Distinct from the single trajectory prediction which rely on strong temporal correlation, in the complex scenes, the trajectory reflects not only the temporal characteristics of a single person, but the interactive features between human and other moving objects nearby. Therefore, how to deeply describe such temporality and interactivity, and then to generate accurate trajectory prediction results according to the change of the scene has become a major problem in the field of trajectory prediction today. In recent years, deep learning has attracted great attention and achieved success in the trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods capture the influence between pedestrians from a single view, and they fail to consider the multiple factors which have an effect on the decision of pedestrians, such as going straight or turning.","To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time."

Despite policy and design implications, realistic projections of future urban landscape changes were primarily obtained based on street-scale design in earlier studies, leaving questions about the successful integration of repurposed urban elements.","This study aimed to formulate design strategies in an incremental fashion applicable to large areas of cities to enhance the connectivity between AVs and existing transportation modes. A conceptual model was built referring to blocks of different forms and functions in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, to extend our designs from the street level to the district level. Urban elements—streets, public spaces and transit systems—were redesigned and merged into the patchwork concept, which links different street and zone types as an efficient system. The above urban design concept proposes the separation of AVs and regular vehicles and adopts unique linkage structures to effectively connect zones assigned to AV usage.

Automatic understanding of the scene, and the associated provision of situational awareness for emergency situations, are able to efficiently contribute to such domains.","In this study, a Video Analytics Edge Computing (VAEC) system is presented that performs real-time enhanced situation awareness for person detection in a video surveillance manner that is also able to share geolocated person detection alerts and other accompanied crucial information. The VAEC system adopts state-of-the-art object detection and tracking algorithms, and it is integrated with the proposed Distribute Edge Computing Internet of Things (DECIoT) platform. The aforementioned alerts and information are able to be shared, though the DECIoT, to smart city platforms utilizing proper middleware. To verify the utility and functionality of the VAEC system, extended experiments were performed (i) in several light conditions, (ii) using several camera sensors, and (iii) in several use cases, such as installed in fixed position of a building or mounted to a car. The results highlight the potential of VAEC system to be exploited by decision-makers or city authorities, providing enhanced situational awareness."
10.1109/TITS.2020.3030259,Understanding and Modeling Urban Mobility Dynamics via Disentangled Representation Learning,Zhang H.,"Understanding the underlying patterns of the urban mobility dynamics is essential for both the traffic state estimation and management of urban facilities and services. Due to the coupling relationship of generative factors in spatial-temporal domain, it is challenging to model the citywide traffic dynamics under a structural pattern of critical features such as hours of days, days of weeks and weather conditions.","To address this challenge, this article develops a disentangled representation learning framework to learn an interpretable factorized representation of the independent data generative factors. In order to make full use of the knowledge on generative factors, this article proposes spatial-temporal generative adversarial network (ST-GAN) to assign the generative factors of traffic flow to the feature vector in latent space and reconstructs the high-dimensional citywide traffic flow from the given factors. With the help of the disentangled representations, the decomposed feature vector in latent space discloses the relationship between underlying patterns and citywide traffic dynamics. Several comprehensively experiments show that ST-GAN not only effectively improves the prediction accuracy but also promisingly characterize structural properties of the traffic evolution process."

10.1109/ICDMW58026.2022.00028,FastFlow: AI for Fast Urban Wind Velocity Prediction,Low S.J.,"Data-driven approaches, including deep learning, have shown great promise as surrogate models across many domains, including computer vision and natural language pro-cessing. These extend to various areas in sustainability, including for satellite image analysis to obtain information such as land usage and extent of development. An interesting direction for which data-driven methods have not been applied much yet is in the quick quantitative evaluation of urban layouts for planning and design. In particular, urban designs typically involve complex trade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up and/or consideration of urban heat island effect. Hence, it can be beneficial to urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban characteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity, without having to run compu-tationally expensive and time-consuming high-fidelity numerical simulations each time. This fast surrogate can then be potentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including generative models or other gradient-based methods.","Here we present an investigation into the use of convolutional neural networks as a surrogate for urban layout characterization that is typically done via high-fidelity numerical simulation. We then further apply this model towards a first demonstration of its utility for data-driven pedestrian-level wind velocity prediction. The data set in this work comprises results from high-fidelity numerical simulations of wind velocities for a diverse set of realistic urban layouts, based on randomized samples from a real-world, highly built-up urban city. We then provide prediction results obtained from the neural network trained on this data-set, demonstrating test errors of under 0.1 m/s for previously unseen novel urban layouts. We further illustrate how this can be useful for purposes such as rapid evaluation of pedestrian wind velocity for a potential new layout. In addition, it is hoped that this data set will further inspire, facilitate and accelerate research in data-driven urban AI, even as our baseline model facilitates quantitative comparison to future, more innovative methods."

However, most existing methods require the target city to provide a large amount of traffic data. Once traffic estimation is performed in a 'new' city where many urban services and transportation infrastructures are not built and thus no prior data is available, those works would fail due to the lack of data.","In this paper, we aim to solve the conditional urban traffic estimation problem in case of data scarcity (i.e., the target city cannot provide any prior data) and tackle the main challenges including (1) knowledge learning from the source and (2) knowledge adaptation without prior traffic data. We propose a novel generative adversarial network - Meta Spatial-Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (Mest-GAN), which can successfully estimate traffic in the target city based on local travel demands without the access to any prior traffic data. To address the first challenge, we learn the latent distribution of travel demands with the inference network, the latent distribution also indicates the diverse spatial-temporal traffic patterns. To solve the second challenge, we use the travel demand data in the target city for adaptation, where the inference network infers a latent code guiding the generator to produce accurate traffic estimations. Extensive experiments on real-world multiple-city datasets demonstrate that our Mest-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods."

Current research uses data mining of tweets and specific posts to provide population trends, but there is no work done in social network analysis for the same end.","This paper proposes an applied informatics application with social network usage to aid in the lack of data due to nonexistent traffic sensors. The Twitter API was used to download a network of users that follows traffic updates accounts and then, use a model of information diffusion (independent cascade model) to retrieve a variable that holds a metric of how the information regarding current traffic has traveled through the network. Finally, an updated traffic dataset with the new social network variable is used to train and validate an LSTM neural network to show if the new variable can be a predictor for traffic. Results show that a deterministic independent cascade model ran on a New York City-based 2-tier social network marginally improved the prediction by 0.4%. This proposal can be replicated in other information diffusion models."

Existing visualization tools are self-contained systems that work independently from other visualization software and do not provide real-time analysis of the pipes and water flow status in the WDN. Using digital maps such as Google Maps it is possible to extend the traditional digital representation of the WDN based on EPANET software. Moreover, the WDN representation can be enriched with localized information (e.g. roads or buildings superimposed on the WDN), that is useful for planning maintenance and structural services. In presence of a WDN equipped with sensors and flowmeters, the proposed tool can be used for optimized visualization of the flow rate and the condition of the pipes in real-time. For these reasons, this tool can be a powerful instrument to help technicians quickly identify problems in the WDN. In this work, we used synthetic data generation techniques to obtain a data-set of values that updated over time. Finally, to evaluate the designed solution, we implemented the proposed visualization tool and performed some experiments to test its effectiveness."

However, it is very challenging since urban flow is affected by complex semantic factors and has multi-scale dependencies on both spatial and temporal dimensional features. Moreover, it’s difficult for most existing one-step urban flow prediction models to predict several future time steps in a short time accurately.","Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in video prediction and image generation, in this paper we propose a Seq2Seq Spatial-Temporal Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks named STS-GAN for multi-step urban flow prediction. We regard citywide urban flow data in successive time steps as image frames of a video. Specifically, we first design a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Encoder (STSE) to capture relative semantic factors and spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously at each time step, which consists of Residual Convolution units. Then a Seq2Seq GAN model is proposed to generate a sequence of future urban flow predictions based on historical data. Furthermore, by integrating GAN’s adversarial loss with prediction error, our STS-GAN can effectively address the blurry prediction issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale urban flow datasets in Beijing and Guangzhou, which demonstrate STS-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods."

As design and planning functions increasingly overlap, it is the hope that technologies like machine learning and other digital tools will evolve and proliferate to enable designers to employ data-driven analyses in informing a wider range of design decisions.","This chapter proposes a potential use case for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the planning and design process. GANs are used to develop novel impressionistic aerial imagery—or urban impressions—based on a variety of inputs common to practice such as variations of land use and/or land cover. The GANs make extensive use of readily-available, tiled, web-format maps in both their training and prediction. The generated urban impressions were evaluated based on a range of qualitative criteria, including their ability to foster increased dialogue between parties. Additionally, this research included the development of a prototype tool that creates urban impressions based on selected inputs early on in the predesign phase. Ultimately, it is the hope that this prototype “sketch tool” will allow practitioners to use GANs to test out initial “sketched” approaches in planning and design and communicate them to the client for early feedback."

There is a need for street designs that encourages cooperation between road users. Shared space is a street design approach that softens the demarcation of vehicles and pedestrian traffic by reducing traffic rules, traffic signals, road marking, and regulations. Understanding the interactions and trajectory formations of various VRUs will facilitate the design of safer shared spaces.","In line with this goal, this paper aims to develop a methodology for generating VRUs trajectories that accounts for behaviors and social interactions. We develop a receding horizon optimization-based pedestrian trajectory planning algorithm capable of modeling pedestrian trajectories in a variety of shared space scenarios. Focusing on three scenarios-group interactions, unidirectional interaction, and fixed obstacle interaction-case studies are performed to demonstrate the strengths of the resulting generative model. Additionally, generated trajectories are validated using two benchmark datasets - DUT and TrajNet++. The three case studies are shown to yield low or near-zero Mean Euclidean Distance and Final Displacement Error values supporting the performance validity of the models. We also analyze gait parameters (step length and step frequency) to further demonstrate the model's capability at generating realistic pedestrian trajectories."

Due to the scarcity of real-life urban traffic data, many transportation planning applications need to generate synthesized traffic flows based on the real-life trajectory datasets. However, those synthesized traffic flows can only fit the input trajectories, which are static and does not reflect the real traffic distributions.","In this paper, we use a stochastic origin-destination (OD) matrix to represent the density of the dynamic traffic flows and then develop a dynamic traffic flow generator. We extract the stochastic OD matrix from the trajectory data, design an efficient neural network to the predict successive stochastic OD matrices, and deploy our model on a real-world road network. The proposed model surpasses the existing generative model in RMSE, MAE, VAR, KL indicators, and is significantly better than the existing model in the MAE indicator. Our traffic generator is able to dynamically adjust urban traffics to generate different simulation environments."

The building morphology and blocks constitute the simulation cases and are simulated considering seven cities in four thermal climate zones. The climate characteristic parameters and geographic location information of the cities are used as the input for the simulation to obtain a regression model that can be applied in most areas of China to predict the shading effect. Grasshopper and EnergyPlus were used to develop the physical models and estimate the building loads for stand-alone buildings or buildings in a network. The results demonstrate that the influence of shading varies significantly under different scenarios, and cooling loads can be over-estimated up to 45% and heating load under-estimated up to 21% in some cities such as Lanzhou. Using the distribution range of 95% relative errors to evaluate the reliability and generalization of the model, the results show that the established support vector regression can effectively calculate the shading effect. The proposed method can quickly estimate the building energy demand by considering the shading effect, which is expected to provide technical support for urban design and energy planning."

An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured three-dimensional (3D) virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include clouds, which degrade image quality. These clouds can be removed by using a generative adversarial network (GAN), which leads to improvements in training quality.","Therefore, the objective of this research was to propose a method for automatically generating building mask images by using 3D virtual models with textured aerial photographs. In this study, using GAN to remove clouds in aerial photographs improved training quality.

Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain.

The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used pedestrian attribute data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CSVFL approach outperforms multiple recently reported pedestrian gender recognition methods."

We propose a novel vectorized city block representation utilizing a ring topology and a two-tier graph to capture the global and local structures of a city block. Each land lot is abstracted into a vector representation covering both its 3D geometry and land use semantics. Such vectorized representation enables us to deploy a lightweight network to capture the underlying distribution of land lots configurations in a city block. To enforce intrinsic spatial constraints of a valid city block, a set of effective loss functions are imposed to shape rational results. We contribute a pilot city block dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our representation and framework over the state-of-the-art. Notably, our BlockPlanner is also able to edit and manipulate city blocks, enabling several useful applications, e.g., topology refinement and footprint generation."

Inspired by image generation, deep urban planning aims to leverage deep learning to generate land-use configurations. However, urban planning is a complex process. Existing studies usually ignore the need of personalized human guidance in planning, and spatial hierarchical structure in planning generation. Moreover, the lack of large-scale land-use configuration samples poses a data sparsity challenge.","This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present extensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method."

However, these systems give a high rate of false alert and are easily deceived by sophisticated attacks such as variants of attacks containing perturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously evaluate and improve these systems by simulating mutation of real-world network attack.","Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks. The experiments are performed and evaluated through 2 criteria: Detection rate (DR) and F1 Score (F1) on the public dataset, named CICIDS2017. DIGFuPAS can be used for continuously pentesting and evaluating IDS's capability once integrated as an automated sustainability test pipeline for SDN-enabled networks."

The rapid growth of Generative Adversarial Networks takes it to a complete new level. Deepfake or deep neural network based face morphing, a.k.a deep-morph attack, presents a significant threat to Facial Recognition System.","In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network based detection method of deep morphed deepfake images which is suitable for IoT environments in smart cities.

In addition, we adopt simulation tools and generative adversarial networks to train the trajectory prediction model so that the private vehicle trajectory dataset conforming to social rules (e.g., collisionless) is generated. Finally, we construct from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives to verify dataset generation methods proposed in this paper. The results show that the generated data not only has high accuracy and is valuable but can provide strong data support for the Internet of Vehicles and transportation research work."
10.1007/978-981-16-2629-6_4,"Experimenting the Impact of Pedestrianisation on Urban Pollution Using Tangible Agent-Based Simulations: Application to Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi, Vietnam",Brugière A.,"The development of permanent or temporary pedestrian areas, whether for leisure or to decrease air pollution, has become an integral part of urban planning in numerous cities around the world. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, began to implement its first area, around the iconic Hoan Kiem lake, a few years ago. In most of cases, however, road closure is likely to deport traffic to nearby neighbourhoods with the consequences of intensifying congestion and, possibly, increasing air pollution in these areas. Because this outcome might appear counter-intuitive to most stakeholders, it is becoming more and more necessary to analyse, assess and share the impacts of these developments in terms of traffic and pollution shifts before implementing them. In this project, we used the GAMA platform to build an agent-based model that simulates the traffic, its emissions of air pollutants, and the diffusion of these pollutants in the district of Hoan Kiem. This simulation has been designed so as to serve either as a decision support tool for local authorities or as an awareness-raising tool for the general public: thanks to its display on a physical 3D model of the district, people can effectively and naturally interact with it at public venues. Although more accurate data and more realistic diffusion models are necessary and will need further research in the future, the simulation is already able to reflect traffic and air pollution peaks during rush hours, allowing residents and developers to understand the impact of pedestrianization on air quality in different scenarios.","The development of permanent or temporary pedestrian areas, whether for leisure or to decrease air pollution, has become an integral part of urban planning in numerous cities around the world.

10.52842/conf.caadria.2021.2.377,Can a generative adversarial network remove thin clouds in aerial photographs?: Toward improving the accuracy of generating horizontal building mask images for deep learning in urban planning and design,Ikeno K.,"Information extracted from aerial photographs is widely used in the fields of urban planning and architecture. An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured 3D virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include thin clouds, which degrade image quality.","In this research, the thin clouds in these aerial photographs are removed by using a generative adversarial network, which leads to improvements in training accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a method for automatically generating building mask images by using 3D virtual models with textured aerial photographs to enable the removable of thin clouds so that the image can be used for deep learning. A model trained on datasets generated by the proposed method was able to detect buildings in aerial photographs with an accuracy of IoU = 0.651."
10.1186/s13673-020-00252-8,Newspaper article-based agent control in smart city simulations,Kim E.,"The latest research on smart city technologies mainly focuses on utilizing cities’ resources to improve the quality of the lives of citizens. Diverse kinds of control signals from massive systems and devices such as adaptive traffic light systems in smart cities can be collected and utilized. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect a massive dataset of control signals as doing so in the real-world requires significant effort and time.","This paper proposes a deep generative model which integrates a long short-term memory model with generative adversarial network (LSTM-GAN) to generate agent control signals based on the words extracted from newspaper articles to solve the problem of collecting massive signals. The discriminatory network in the LSTM-GAN takes continuous word embedding vectors as inputs generated by a pre-trained Word2Vec model. The agent control signals of sequential actions are simultaneously predicted by the LSTM-GAN in real time. Specifically, to collect the training data of smart city simulations, the LSTM-GAN is trained based on the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) newspaper dataset, which contains 5,317,731 sentences, for a total of 93,626,203 word tokens, from written texts. To verify the proposed method, agent control signals were generated and validated. In the training of the LSTM-GAN, the accuracy of the discriminator converged to 50%. In addition, the losses of the discriminator and the generator converged from 4527.04 and 4527.94 to 2.97 and 1.87, respectively."
10.1145/3397536.3422268,Reimagining City Configuration: Automated Urban Planning via Adversarial Learning,Wang D.,"Urban planning refers to the efforts of designing land-use configurations. Effective urban planning can help to mitigate the operational and social vulnerability of a urban system, such as high tax, crimes, traffic congestion and accidents, pollution, depression, and anxiety. Due to the high complexity of urban systems, such tasks are mostly completed by professional planners. But, human planners take longer time. The recent advance of deep learning motivates us to ask: can machines learn at a human capability to automatically and quickly calculate land-use configuration, so human planners can finally adjust machine-generated plans for specific needs? To this end, we formulate the automated urban planning problem into a task of learning to configure land-uses, given the surrounding spatial contexts. To set up the task, we define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor, where each channel is a category of POIs and the value of an entry is the number of POIs. The objective is then to propose an adversarial learning framework that can automatically generate such tensor for an unplanned area. In particular, we first characterize the contexts of surrounding areas of an unplanned area by learning representations from spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data. Second, we combine each unplanned area and its surrounding context representation as a tuple, and categorize all the tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas).","Third, we develop an adversarial land-use configuration approach, where the surrounding context representation is fed into a generator to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish among positive and negative samples. Finally, we devise two new measurements to evaluate the quality of land-use configurations and present extensive experiment and visualization results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
10.1177/2053951720965618,Data/infrastructure in the smart city: Understanding the infrastructural power of Citymapper app through technicity of data,Tavmen G.,"Over the last few years, smart cities have been a focus of scholarly attention. Most of these critical studies concentrated on the multinational corporations’ discourses and their implications on urban policies. Besides these factors, however, the data-driven city develops within a complex web of entanglements whereby data-driven technologies modulate the urban infrastructure in a multitude of ways contingent upon the social, political, material and technical aspects.","As such, this article attends to the infrastructural implications of a smart city product, Citymapper, which is a transport app built on open data available as part of London’s smart city planning. In order to establish the relationship between data and infrastructure, I use Gilbert Simondon’s notions of ‘transduction’, ‘individuation’ and ‘technicity’ to explore this relationship in a processual and relational way. In constructing this relationship as co-generative, whereby infrastructure and data transindividuate, I subsequently posit the term data/infrastructure. Against this theoretical background, I study the ways in which Citymapper individuates and thereby gains infrastructural power through technicity of data by studying the ways in which the users’ contribute to data generation that feed back into the app. Specifically, by following the transformation of the app from initially mediating the bus timetable to transducing users into environmental sensing nodes through which the app collects behavioural data, I foreground the epistemological, infrastructural and social consequences of Citymapper’s infrastructural power for the data-driven city."
10.1080/15481603.2018.1533680,Simulation of landscape spatial layout evolution in rural-urban fringe areas: a case study of Ganjingzi District,Yang J.,"In recent years, the rapid expansion of urban spaces has accelerated the mutual evolution of landscape types. Analyzing and simulating spatio-temporal dynamic features of urban landscape can help to reveal its driving mechanisms and facilitate reasonable planning of urban land resources.","The purpose of this study was to design a hybrid cellular automata model to simulate dynamic change in urban landscapes. The model consists of four parts: a geospatial partition, a Markov chain (MC), a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), and cellular automata (CA). This study employed multivariate land use data for the period 2000–2015 to conduct spatial clustering for the Ganjingzi District and to simulate landscape status evolution via a divisional composite cellular automaton model. During the period of 2000–2015, construction land and forest land areas in Ganjingzi District increased by 19.43% and 15.19%, respectively, whereas farmland, garden lands, and other land areas decreased by 43.42%, 52.14%, and 75.97%, respectively. Land use conversion potentials in different sub-regions show different characteristics in space. The overall land-change prediction accuracy for the subarea-composite model is 3% higher than that of the non-partitioned model, and misses are reduced by 3.1%. Therefore, by integrating geospatial zoning and the MLP-ANN hybrid method, the land type conversion rules of different zonings can be obtained, allowing for more effective simulations of future urban land use change. The hybrid cellular automata model developed here will provide a reference for urban planning and policy formulation."
10.3390/ijgi8030154,Geographical area network-structural health monitoring utility computing model,Tariq H.,"In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena and geographical expansion, there is a pressing need for a more effective environment logging for a better management and urban planning.","This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM."
10.1007/978-3-030-27157-2_13,Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for Urban Green Space Mapping in Urbanizing Indian Cities,Lahoti S.,"Geospatial data of urban green spaces (UGS) is mostly unavailable for emerging Indian cities, which effects their provisioning, maintenance and monitoring. In absence of spatial data, the strategic vision and comprehensive urban planning to enhance urban environment of cities witnessing transition are compromised. Owing to the direct link between urban environment and wellbeing of urban dweller, it is utmost important to address this gap and support planning process by providing the required data set of desired spatial and temporal scale. Though satellite imagery and remotely sensed data are widely used in environmental studies, for urban greens the spatial resolution of images is inapt. In addition, high cost acts as a barrier towards its wide scale application.","Thus, the study reviews current state of literature on application of UAVs for spatial data generation to allow integrated analysis to support urban planning process. A case example of Nagpur city is presented to highlight specific direct applications. The review finds UAVs as cost effective and efficient tool for images with relevant resolution for planners and decision makers. While regulation hinder its wide applicability, the cost component, flexibility, timely monitoring and accessibility weighs UAVs as suitable tool for data collection in urban areas. As use of UAVs in urban areas is still limited, the study recommends more experimentations and trials to arrive at set methodology which could help in mapping of UGS and other qualitative data gathering to support urban planning and urban greening."
