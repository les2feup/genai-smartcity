We found that European citizens place little emphasis on the social sustainability pillar.

    "text":"The objective of this study is to propose a transformer-based UNet-like framework for end-to-end building change detection, integrating multi-temporal and multi-source data to improve efficiency and accuracy. Unlike conventional methods that focus on either spectral imagery or digital surface models (DSMs), the proposed method combines RGB color imagery, DSMs, and building vector maps in a three-branch Siamese architecture to enhance spatial, spectral, and elevation-based feature extraction. We chose Hsinchu, Taiwan as the experimental site and used 1:1000 digital topographic maps and airborne imagery from 2017, 2020, and 2023. The experimental results demonstrated that the data fusion model significantly outperforms other data combinations, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in detecting building changes. The RGB images provide spectral and texture details, DSMs offer structural and elevation context, and the building vector map enhances semantic consistency. This research advances building change detection by introducing a fully transformer-based model for end-to-end change detection, incorporating diverse geospatial data sources, and improving accuracy over traditional CNN-based methods. The proposed framework offers a scalable and automated solution for modern mapping workflows, contributing to more efficient geospatial data updating and urban monitoring.",

The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images.

To achieve this goal, our model constitutes an adversarial framework between the generator and the discriminator. Specifically, the generator aims to generate a fused image with basic intensity information together with the optimal texture details from source images, while the discriminator aims to force the fused image to restore the salient thermal targets from the source infrared image. In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on publicly available datasets RoadScene and TNO demonstrate the superiority of our FusionADA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Extensive evaluations on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets across diverse terrains, including agriculture, urban areas, barren land, and grasslands, demonstrate the model's superiority over existing approaches. It achieves an LPIPS score of 0.27, SSIM of 0.76, and an average inference time of 0.22 s, showcasing its ability to preserve spatial coherence and perceptual quality even in complex, noisy environments.

In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works.

Integration of UAV imagery provides high-resolution spatial data, facilitating precise classification of land cover types. Federated learning (FL) ensures data privacy and reduces communication bandwidth usage by enabling model training on local devices (e.g., UAVs) without the need to share data with a centralized server. However, these UAVs have limited resources and often struggle to capture a sufficient number of images for training a model without encountering overfitting. We address the challenges of scarce data samples on UAVs by leveraging DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate synthetic images, promoting sustainability by minimizing the need for extensive data collection. These synthetic images are used to train local models of UAVs, offering enhanced results while combating overfitting. Our developed FL model achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, indicating a 7% improvement over Vanilla FL. The proposed sustainable approach exhibits promising outcomes in achieving accurate and scalable land cover and land use classification, showcasing its applicability in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and precision agriculture.",

    "text":"We develop several Bayesian approaches to spatial sharing of information between neighborhoods while modeling trends in crime counts over time. We apply our methodology to estimate changes in crime throughout Philadelphia over the 2006-15 period while also incorporating spatially-varying economic and demographic predictors. We find that the local shrinkage imposed by a conditional autoregressive model has substantial benefits in terms of out-of-sample predictive accuracy of crime. We also explore the possibility of spatial discontinuities between neighborhoods that could represent natural barriers or aspects of the built environment.",
