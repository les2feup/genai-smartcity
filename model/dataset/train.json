This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE\/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE\/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 variables). The VAE\/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples.",
