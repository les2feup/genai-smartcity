The classification system explores the predisposition of citizens to contribute to the three pillars of sustainability when choosing a destination to visit based on gender, age, and the region of living. We found that European citizens place little emphasis on the social sustainability pillar. While they care about preserving the environment, this competes with the cultural offerings and availability of activities at the destination.

        "text": "The objective of this study is to propose a transformer-based UNet-like framework for end-to-end building change detection, integrating multi-temporal and multi-source data to improve efficiency and accuracy. Unlike conventional methods that focus on either spectral imagery or digital surface models (DSMs), the proposed method combines RGB color imagery, DSMs, and building vector maps in a three-branch Siamese architecture to enhance spatial, spectral, and elevation-based feature extraction. We chose Hsinchu, Taiwan as the experimental site and used 1:1000 digital topographic maps and airborne imagery from 2017, 2020, and 2023. The experimental results demonstrated that the data fusion model significantly outperforms other data combinations, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in detecting building changes. The RGB images provide spectral and texture details, DSMs offer structural and elevation context, and the building vector map enhances semantic consistency. This research advances building change detection by introducing a fully transformer-based model for end-to-end change detection, incorporating diverse geospatial data sources, and improving accuracy over traditional CNN-based methods. The proposed framework offers a scalable and automated solution for modern mapping workflows, contributing to more efficient geospatial data updating and urban monitoring.",

In this paper, a method is designed to process the images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), employing a model UAV, to further develop of our current research. The preliminary test shows that it is promising to use a UAV and machine learning to develop an expedited infrastructure condition evaluation following natural disasters because of its automatic and non-contact nature. The preliminary outcomes show the detection rates have satisfying FN rates and very low FP rates. Besides, the designed algorithm and data-gathering method provides a real-time and on-site computation capability that reduces the quantity of data to be stored by filtering out unnecessary data instantly.",

Specifically, the proposed approach considers the complete travel chain of individuals, establishes a spatiotemporal constraint representation model, and utilizes GANs to simulate the distribution of passenger travel, obtaining more compact and high-level travel vector features. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately captures passengers’ travel patterns in both the temporal and spatial dimensions, offering technical support for urban transportation planning.",

Meanwhile, a mixed attention (MA) is proposed to aggregate long-range contextual relationships and fuse low-level features with high-level features. Second, an FCN-based full convolution discriminator task network is designed to help evaluate the feasibility of unlabeled image prediction results. We performed experimental validation on three datasets, and the results show that MDMANet segmentation provides more significant improvement in accuracy and better generalization than existing segmentation networks.",

Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images. This method has broadened the applications of deep learning in haze removal, particularly highlighting its potential in the fields of autonomous driving and smart cities.",

In our model, we are committed to extracting and fusing the optimal texture details and salient thermal targets from the source images. To achieve this goal, our model constitutes an adversarial framework between the generator and the discriminator. Specifically, the generator aims to generate a fused image with basic intensity information together with the optimal texture details from source images, while the discriminator aims to force the fused image to restore the salient thermal targets from the source infrared image. In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on publicly available datasets RoadScene and TNO demonstrate the superiority of our FusionADA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Extensive evaluations on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets across diverse terrains, including agriculture, urban areas, barren land, and grasslands, demonstrate the model's superiority over existing approaches. It achieves an LPIPS score of 0.27, SSIM of 0.76, and an average inference time of 0.22 s, showcasing its ability to preserve spatial coherence and perceptual quality even in complex, noisy environments.

        "text": "To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid DoS Attack Intrusion Detection System (HDA-IDS) that combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to effectively identify both known and unknown DoS/botnet attacks. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel anomaly-based detection model called CL-GAN. It integrates CNN-LSTM with GAN to establish a baseline for normal behavior and detect malicious traffic. In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in addressing security issues in IoT networks, and presents a general framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale attacks constructed through the dissemination of false information.",

        "text": "This paper introduces a novel approach method for decentralized land cover and land use classification, utilizing federated learning in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on imagery obtained from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Integration of UAV imagery provides high-resolution spatial data, facilitating precise classification of land cover types. Federated learning (FL) ensures data privacy and reduces communication bandwidth usage by enabling model training on local devices (e.g., UAVs) without the need to share data with a centralized server. However, these UAVs have limited resources and often struggle to capture a sufficient number of images for training a model without encountering overfitting. We address the challenges of scarce data samples on UAVs by leveraging DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate synthetic images, promoting sustainability by minimizing the need for extensive data collection. These synthetic images are used to train local models of UAVs, offering enhanced results while combating overfitting. Our developed FL model achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, indicating a 7% improvement over Vanilla FL. The proposed sustainable approach exhibits promising outcomes in achieving accurate and scalable land cover and land use classification, showcasing its applicability in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and precision agriculture.",

We apply our methodology to estimate changes in crime throughout Philadelphia over the 2006-15 period while also incorporating spatially-varying economic and demographic predictors. We find that the local shrinkage imposed by a conditional autoregressive model has substantial benefits in terms of out-of-sample predictive accuracy of crime. We also explore the possibility of spatial discontinuities between neighborhoods that could represent natural barriers or aspects of the built environment.",
