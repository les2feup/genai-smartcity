10.1016/j.landurbplan.2025.105365,A hybrid framework for regional land valuation using generative intelligence and AutoML techniques,Jiang F.,"Land value is a crucial indicator of economic dynamics and regional development, providing essential information for urban planning and policy development. However, most existing studies estimate a singular land value over large areas, lacking the fine-grained details for urban management.","This study therefore develops a RAHGV (relative-to-absolute hybrid generative valuation) framework for regional land valuation, which combines a hybrid learning strategy with deep generative modeling to produce high-resolution, spatially continuous land value distribution across extensive urban areas. In a case study of New York City (NYC), the RAHGV model outperforms typical one-step models by differentiating between local land variations and broader regional tendencies. Its bi-attention bottleneck significantly improves model performance, reducing MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 45.75% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) by 69.86% compared to conventional deep generative methods. Local physical infrastructure and mixed land-use patterns primarily influence micro-scale land values, while community amenities and economic vibrancy drive macro-scale values. The findings highlight the potential of the RAHGV framework as a powerful tool for promoting sustainable urban development by delivering high-resolution, data-driven insights that support informed decision-making in rapidly evolving urban environments."

Current road networks, especially in large cities, face acute pressures due to increased demand for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Although much attention has been given to improve traffic management and accommodate the increased demand via coordinating and optimizing traffic signals, research focused on adapting the static allocation of street spaces and right-of-way dynamically based on mixed traffic flow is still scarce.","This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) agent approach that cooperatively adapts the individual lane widths and right-of-way access permissions based on real-world mixed traffic flow. In particular, multiple cooperative agents are trained with mixed temporal data that learn to decide suitable lane widths for motorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, along with whether co-sharing space between pedestrians and cyclists is safe. Using a microscopic traffic simulator model of a four-legged intersection, we trained our RL agent on synthetic data, and tested it on realistic multi-modal traffic data. The proposed approach reduces the overall average waiting time and queue length by 48.9% and 37.7%, respectively, compared to the Static (baseline) street design. Additionally, we observe CALM's ability to gradually adjust lane widths, contrasting with the Heuristic implementation's erratic lane adjustments, which pose potential safety concerns. Notably, the model learns to adaptively toggle the co-sharing of street space between cyclists and pedestrians as one co-shared lane, ensuring comfort and maintaining the level of service according to the designer's policy. Finally, we demonstrate CALM's scalability on a simulated large-scale traffic network."

In addition, the high resolution of mmWave signals allows mmPalm to extract detailed palm characteristics (e.g., palm geometry, skin thickness, and texture) that can assemble distinctive palmprints for user authentication. Our innovative virtual antennas design further increases the spatial resolution of a commercial mmWave device, enabling it to fully capture the comprehensive palmprint features. Moreover, to address the challenge of small-scale environmental changes (e.g., variations in palm-device distances and palm orientations), we design a novel palm profile augmentation method, utilizing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic palm profiles for mitigating palm instability. Furthermore, we design a cross-environment adaptation framework based on transfer learning to address the challenge of large-scale environmental changes, including multipath variations introduced by human bodies and nearby furniture. Extensive experiments with 30 participants through 6 months demonstrate that mmPalm achieves 99% authentication accuracy with resilience against different types of attacks, including random, impersonation, and counterfeit."

Digital twins (DTs) are promising cutting-edge technologies that can transform the future transport ecosystem into an autonomous and resilient system. However, since DT is a data-driven solution based on AI, proper data management is essential in implementing DT as a service (DTaaS). One of the challenges in DT development is the availability of real-life data, particularly for training algorithms and verifying the functionality of DT. The current article focuses on data augmentation through synthetic data generation.","This approach can facilitate the development of DT in case the developers do not have enough data to train the machine learning (ML) algorithm. The current twinning approach provides a prospective ideal state of the engine used for proactive monitoring of the engine’s health as an anomaly detection service.
