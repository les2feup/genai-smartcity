10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125712,CityTFT: A temporal fusion transformer-based surrogate model for urban building energy modeling,Dai T.Y.,"Almost one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions are from buildings and nearly 70 % of energy is consumed in urban areas. To address this as a long-term issue, accurately predicting building energy use at the urban level is indispensable. Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is an emerging method to investigate urban design and energy systems at urban and neighborhood levels. UBEM methods are considered reasonably accurate in simulating the performance of almost any building combinations. However, customized urban projects, and optimization problems involving many UBEM scenarios, are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and based on the scalability, the simulation runtime can be exponentially high if a broad set of design variations is analyzed.","Here, we propose a data-driven approach to generate a surrogate model for UBEM and accelerate the simulation process. Based on the extensively used forecasting model, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), we extract the static covariate encoder and variable selection network from the TFT structure while adding a small neural network to model the probability of triggering heating and cooling needs. The major advantages compared to other surrogate models are: (i) A sequential input in the transformer-based model to improve the temporal accuracy. (ii) A physics-inspired training strategy that builds on weather dynamics and urban interactions for hourly energy demands concurrently with a customized loss function. (iii) Improved generalizability for the proposed surrogate model using open and public data. In our study of 114 buildings in different climate zones in the US, our model predicts heating and cooling triggers in unseen climate dynamics with an F1 score of 0.83 while the root mean squared error (RMSE) of hourly loads was 71.51 kWh. This model is available for interfacing with climate projections and city-scale analysis as part of atmospheric urban digital twins."
10.1016/j.eswa.2025.127182,Demystifying SAR with attention,Patnaik N.,"Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is indispensable for earth observation, offering the ability to capture data under challenging conditions such as cloud cover and darkness. However, its grayscale format and speckle noise hinder interpretability and pose significant challenges for traditional processing methods.","This study introduces an innovative framework for SAR image colorization, leveraging an Attention-Based WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty). The model incorporates multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction, capture long-range dependencies, and dynamically suppress noise through a novel variance-based attention adjustment mechanism. Extensive evaluations on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets across diverse terrains, including agriculture, urban areas, barren land, and grasslands, demonstrate the model's superiority over existing approaches. It achieves an LPIPS score of 0.27, SSIM of 0.76, and an average inference time of 0.22 s, showcasing its ability to preserve spatial coherence and perceptual quality even in complex, noisy environments. This capability enables real-time applications in disaster management, flood monitoring, and urban planning, providing actionable insights and advancing the state-of-the-art in SAR image processing."
10.1016/j.landusepol.2025.107535,A green infrastructure planning approach for enhanced flood control and resilience in urban areas,Rahman M.R.,Urban flooding presents a growing challenge in metropolitan areas due to climate change and increasing impervious surfaces.,"This research proposes a Green Infrastructure (GI) planning approach to enhance flood control and resilience in the flood-prone Yeoksam-dong region of Gangnam, Seoul, South Korea. A mixed-method approach was employed, incorporating both residents’ preferences and hydrological simulations using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to assess the effectiveness of various GI controls. Key GI co-benefits were identified through importance–performance analysis (IPA) and fuzzy weight rankings. Based on these, three GI scenarios were developed and evaluated for their flood mitigation potential. Scenario 1 (infiltration trench, rain garden, and rain barrel) emerged as the most effective, reducing surface runoff by 18.56 % and achieving the best cost-benefit ratio of 1.01 over a 10-year period. Scenario 2 (bio-retention, pervious pavement, and green roof), while less effective in terms of flood mitigation, may still offer ecological and social co-benefits. The study also conducted a sensitivity analysis, which confirmed Scenario 1’s robustness across various levels of imperviousness, making it a highly adaptable solution for urban settings. This research highlights the importance of community engagement in GI planning and demonstrates how integrating hydrological performance with socioeconomic benefits can enhance urban resilience. By aligning with the 4Rs of resilience; robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners seeking cost-effective, scalable solutions for flood-prone areas. The findings underscore the value of multifunctional GI controls in not only reducing flood risks but also promoting long-term sustainability and community well-being."

Identifying the locations and types of street-level dumpsites is a necessary first step for waste management; however, existing studies lack automated and accurate methods for detecting and categorizing these sites. As a result, governments face substantial labor and financial burdens in managing illegal dumping.","To address these gaps, this study presents MultiSense DumpSpotter, a novel cascade model framework that integrates a multimodal deep learning architecture with Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify, classify, and analyze improper dumpsites with greater accuracy than traditional unimodal vision models. To support this framework, we developed UrbanDumpSight, the first annotated street-level urban dumpsite dataset, consisting of over 4000 street view images with metadata that includes geospatial and demographic information. This study contribute to the literature by demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal data fusion in urban studies and the potential of LLMs in interpreting urban semantics.

However, existing models face significant challenges in processing intricate building structures: Transformer-based models suffer from high computational complexity and memory demands, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often struggle to capture features across multiple scales and hierarchical levels.","To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture, Mamba-in-Mamba U-Net (MiM-UNet), which integrates the design principles of state–space models (SSMs) to enhance both computational efficiency and feature extraction capacity. Specifically, MiM-UNet refines the traditional encoder–decoder framework by introducing Mamba-in-Mamba blocks, enabling precise multi-scale feature capture and efficient information fusion.

However, their proliferation exposes them to risks such as data theft, unauthorized modifications, and misuse, hindering secure information sharing and industry growth.","To address these challenges, this paper introduces AWGAN, a robust watermarking method leveraging deep learning. AWGAN extracts deep image features to embed a robust and imperceptible digital watermark, ensuring security while maintaining data usability and visual fidelity. The method employs feature channel weighting to adaptively select key pixels for embedding, enhancing robustness and imperceptibility.

These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption.","This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures."

The majority of humans live their lives in urban environments, using detailed virtual models for applications as diverse as virtual worlds, special effects, and urban planning. Generating such 3D models from exemplars manually is time-consuming, while 3D deep learning approaches have high memory costs. In this paper, we present a technique for training 2D neural networks to repeatedly sculpt a plane into a large-scale 3D urban environment. An initial coarse depth map is created by a GAN model, from which we refine 3D normal and depth using an image translation network regularized by a linear system. The networks are trained using real-world data to allow generative synthesis of meshes at scale. We exploit sculpting from multiple viewpoints to generate a highly detailed, concave, and water-tight 3D mesh. We show cityscapes at scales of 100×1600 meters with more than 2 million triangles, and demonstrate that our results are objectively and subjectively similar to our exemplars.","We introduce a system that learns to sculpt 3D models of massive urban environments.

The simulation method for urban river flooding caused by heavy rainfall has garnered growing attention. However, existing studies primarily concentrate on prediction using hydrodynamic models or machine learning models, and there remains a dearth of a comprehensive prediction framework that couples both models to simulate the temporal evolution of river flood changes.","This research proposes a novel framework for simulating urban pluvial river flooding by integrating physically based models with deep learning approaches. The sample set is enhanced through data augmentation and Generative Adversarial Networks, and scheduling control signals are incorporated into the encoder–decoder architecture to enable urban pluvial river flooding forecasting. The results demonstrate strong model performance, provided that the model’s structural complexity is aligned with the available training data. After incorporating scheduling information, the simulated water level process exhibits a “double-peak” pattern, where the first peak is noticeably lower than that under non-scheduling conditions. The current research introduces an innovative method for simulating and analyzing large-scale urban flooding, offering valuable perspectives for urban planning and flood mitigation strategies."

This research focuses on eight major Chinese coastal cities, leveraging a robust dataset of 4712 samples to train the generative models. Quantitative evaluations demonstrated that the integration of CycleGAN with Pix2Pix substantially improved structural fidelity and realism in urban morphology synthesis, achieving a peak Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.918 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.987. The total adversarial loss in Pix2Pix training stabilized at 0.19 after 811 iterations, ensuring high convergence in urban structure generation. Additionally, CycleGAN-enhanced outputs exhibited a 35% reduction in relative error compared to Pix2Pix-generated images, significantly improving edge preservation and urban feature accuracy. By incorporating LCZ data, the proposed framework successfully bridges urban morphology modeling with climate-responsive urban planning, enabling adaptive design strategies for mitigating UHI effects. This study integrates Pix2Pix and CycleGAN architectures to enhance the realism and structural fidelity of urban morphology generation, while incorporating the LCZ classification framework to produce urban forms that align with specific climatological conditions.

Bike network planning is a tedious process, relying on heuristic computational methods that frequently overlook the broader implications of introducing new cycling infrastructure, in particular the necessity to repurpose car lanes.","In this work, we call for optimizing the trade-off between bike and car networks, effectively pushing for Pareto optimality. This shift in perspective gives rise to a novel linear programming formulation towards optimal bike network allocation. Our experiments, conducted using both real-world and synthetic data, testify the effectiveness and superiority of this optimization approach compared to heuristic methods.

While supervised learning methods in change detection have demonstrated substantial efficacy, they are often hindered by the rising costs associated with data annotation. Semi-supervised methods have attracted increasing interest, offering promising results with limited data labeling. These approaches typically employ strategies such as consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, and generative adversarial networks. However, they usually face the problems of insufficient data augmentation and unbalanced quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling.","To address the above problems, we propose a semi-supervised change detection method with data augmentation and adaptive threshold updating (DA-AT) for high-resolution remote sensing images.

Given the shifts in water supply patterns due to global climate change and ongoing urbanization, understanding and predicting how urban design affects drought is crucial for sustainable human settlements. Previous research has primarily focused on large-scale predictive modeling, making it difficult for architects and urban designers to address potential drought risks.","This study addresses that issue by proposing an urban planning prediction model based on generative adversarial networks that integrates temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) maps. The model is trained on relevant datasets by using Guangzhou as a case study, including land cover, land surface temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index data. TVDI maps are generated from untrained image pairs based on urban planning parameters. Model validation, including accuracy analysis and scenario simulations, is conducted to assess the model's ability to predict urban land surface drought resulting from changes in urban planning. This approach highlights its proactive capacity to anticipate and reveal long-term or gradually unfolding drought trends, offering valid tools for urban design and planning."

A pre-trained object detection model i.e., Grounding DINO, is implemented to efficiently identify buildings. A novel manually labeled training data of detected buildings corresponding to their usage is used to extract features from building facades across diverse Indian cities (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi) using Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Following this, CLIPSeg a pre-trained segmentation model is used to recognizes text specifically on building elements like signs, posters, and banners. We then leverage GPT-3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), fine-tuned with a specifically designed few-shot prompting method, to infer building usage from the recognized text. To achieve optimal performance, the proposed ensemble linear metaclassifier combines predictions from ViT and LLM model. The predicted building usages are attributed to their corresponding locations to develop spatial maps. An analysis of our framework compared against ground truth data collected from various Indian cities reveals significantly accurate outcomes. Our findings highlight the utility of textual information in classifying utilities and commercial buildings, while features extracted from vision models prove more informative for residential buildings. Our approach can automate the generation of roadside building attributes and usage details on a larger scale."

Recently, with significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce richly descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. However, most current RSIC models generally apply only fine-tuning to these datasets without developing models tailored to the unique characteristics of remote sensing imagery.","This article proposes RS-MoE, the first mixture of expert (MoE)-based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE block, which incorporates a novel instruction router and multiple lightweight large language models (LLMs) as expert models. The instruction router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of subtasks. In addition, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions.

Specifically, in urban planning, it is increasingly crucial to prioritize bike lanes, bike stations, and pedestrian zones, for functional transportation infrastructures.","This approach can enhance cities by improving air quality, reducing emissions, and boosting public health and safety through physical activity and accident prevention. However, implementing these changes requires careful planning, community engagement, and stakeholder collaboration. This paper proposes a hybrid model for identifying optimal locations for bike lanes, bike stations, and pedestrian zones adopting Real-Time Spatial Delphi and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Real-Time Spatial Delphi is a modified version of the traditional Delphi method that incorporates real-time feedback and visualization of group response in real-time, aiming to achieve a convergence of opinions among experts on the territory. Nevertheless, these judgments are a spatial representation not visible in reality, and with the spread of artificial intelligence models, different implementations can support the planning process, such as the use of GANs. In this case, GANs can be exploited by adopting pre-existing location images resulting from experts’ judgments to illustrate the proposed intervention’s visual impact.

Among many tasks, urban layout is the foundation for urban regeneration.","In this paper, we target a new task called function-aware urban layout regeneration, and propose UrbanEvolver, a function-aware deep generative model for the task. Given a target region to be regenerated, our model outputs a regenerated urban layout (i.e., roads and buildings) for the target region by considering the function (i.e., land use type) of the target region and its surrounding context (i.e., the functions and urban layouts of the surrounding regions). UrbanEvolver first extracts implicit regeneration rules from the target function and the surrounding context by encoding them separately in different scales through the function-layout adaptive (FA) blocks, and then constrains the regenerated urban layout based on the learned regeneration rules. To enforce the regenerated layout to be valid and to follow the road structure, we design a set of losses covering both pixel-level and geometry-level constraints. To train our model, we collect a large-scale urban layout dataset covering more than 147 K regions under 1300 km2 with rich annotations, including functions, region shapes, urban road layouts, and urban building layouts.

Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios.

The impeding presence of urban buildings often affects the runout behavior and deposition of debris flows. But the impact of different building densities and sizes on debris flow dynamics has yet to be quantified to guide urban planning in debris flow risk zones.","This study focused on a debris flow that occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, China on August 7th, 2010, which was catastrophic and destroyed many buildings. The FLO-2D software was used to simulate this debris flow in two scenarios, i.e. the presence and the absence of buildings, to obtain debris-flow intensity parameters. The developed model was then used to further analyze the influence of large buildings and narrow channels within the urban environment. The simulation results show that considering the presence of buildings in the simulation is essential for accurate assessment of debris flow intensity and deposition distribution. The layout of buildings in the upstream urban area, such as large buildings or parallel buildings which form narrow channels, can affect the flow velocity and depth of debris flow heading towards downstream buildings. To mitigate damage to downstream buildings, the relative spacing (d/a) between upstream and downstream buildings should not exceed a value of two and should ideally be even lower. These findings provide valuable insights for improving the resistance of mountainous cities to urban debris flows."

Deep learning-based techniques can effectively identify consumers involved in energy theft through power consumption data.","In this study, a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-based energy-theft-detection system is proposed to detect data-tampering cyber-attack vectors. CNN is a commonly employed method that automates the extraction of features and the classification process. We employed CNN for feature extraction and traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. In this work, honest data were obtained from a real dataset. Six attack vectors causing data tampering were utilized. Tampered data were synthetically generated through these attack vectors. Six separate datasets were created for each attack vector to design a specialized detector tailored for that specific attack. Additionally, a dataset containing all attack vectors was also generated for the purpose of designing a general detector.

Varanasi is proposed to be developed into a Smart City in the first phase of Indian Smart City Mission. The resilience of a city is its ability to persevere in the face of an emergency, so it can continue functioning despite serious challenges. Flood is a frequent phenomenon for Varanasi, but in recent years, it was deluged. The flood-risk zones mapping makes the first step of flood control measures.","In this chapter, a one-dimensional hydraulic model, i.e. HEC-RAS has been integrated with Remote sensing and GIS techniques to map the floodplain zones of Ganga River located around the city of Varanasi. The pre-processing includes geometry setup such as digitizing the stream centerline, right bank and the left bank of the river. SRTM DEM is used in ArcGIS software extension HEC-GeoRAS 4.3 for pre-processing of GIS data, i.e. derivation of the channel geometry for input to HEC-RAS. Next, HEC-RAS simulations were performed to generate a water surface profile for a given design flood condition. Finally, simulated results have been imported in ArcMap 10.1 and being overlaid with the DEM for obtaining flood risk zones and flood inundation maps. Floodplain map analysis shows that more than 300% area has a probability of inundation as compared to the normal flow of the river.

However, hyperspectral imaging usually suffers from low spatial resolution and high cost, which limits the wide application of hyperspectral data. Spectral super-resolution provides a promising solution to acquire hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution and low cost, taking RGB images as input. Existing spectral super-resolution methods utilize neural networks following a single-shot framework, i.e., final results are obtained by one-stage spectral super-resolution, which struggles to capture and model the complex relationships between spectral bands.","In this article, we propose a spectral-cascaded diffusion model (SCDM), a coarse-to-fine spectral super-resolution method based on the diffusion model. The diffusion model fits the real data distribution through stepwise denoising, which is naturally suitable for modeling rich spectral information. We cascade the diffusion model in the spectral dimension to gradually refine the spectral trends and enrich spectral information of the pixels. The cascade solves the highly ill-posed problem of spectral super-resolution step-by-step, mitigating the inaccuracies of previous single-shot approaches. To better utilize the potential of the diffusion model for spectral super-resolution, we design image condition mixture guidance (ICMG) to enhance the guidance of image conditions and progressive dynamic truncation (PDT) to limit cumulative errors in the sampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral super-resolution. Codes can be found at https://github.com/Mr-Bamboo/SCDM."

Research based on Local Climate Zone (LCZ) has exhibited promising potential for disentangling the interactive mechanisms between urban morphology and local climate.,"In this study, generative adversarial networks (GAN) were employed as surrogate models to facilitate the integration of LCZ and urban morphology data from six metropolises for associative training. Through comparative experiments involving quantitative and qualitative evaluations, a rapid and responsive 3D morphology prediction model was developed for LCZ classifications.

10.3390/rs15133367,MS-AGAN: Road Extraction via Multi-Scale Information Fusion and Asymmetric Generative Adversarial Networks from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images under Complex Backgrounds,Lin S.,"Extracting roads from remote sensing images is of significant importance for automatic road network updating, urban planning, and construction. However, various factors in complex scenes (e.g., high vegetation coverage occlusions) may lead to fragmentation in the extracted road networks and also affect the robustness of road extraction methods.","This study proposes a multi-scale road extraction method with asymmetric generative adversarial learning (MS-AGAN). First, we design an asymmetric GAN with a multi-scale feature encoder to better utilize the context information in high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and feature fusion are integrated into the asymmetric encoder–decoder structure to avoid feature redundancy caused by multi-level cascading operations and enhance the generator network’s ability to extract fine-grained road information at the pixel level. Second, to maintain road connectivity, topologic features are considered in the pixel segmentation process. A linear structural similarity loss ((Formula presented.)) is introduced into the loss function of MS-AGAN, which guides MS-AGAN to generate more accurate segmentation results. Finally, to fairly evaluate the performance of deep models under complex backgrounds, the Bayesian error rate (BER) is introduced into the field of road extraction for the first time. Experiments are conducted via Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images with high vegetation coverage in the Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the public DeepGlobe dataset. The performance of MS-AGAN is compared with a list of advanced models, including RCFSNet, CoANet, UNet, DeepLabV3+, and DiResNet. The final results show that (1) with respect to road extraction performance, the Recall, F1, and IoU values of MS-AGAN on the Daxing dataset are 2.17%, 0.04%, and 2.63% higher than the baselines. On DeepGlobe, the Recall, F1, and IoU of MS-AGAN improve by 1.12%, 0.42%, and 0.25%, respectively. (2) On road connectivity, the Conn index of MS-AGAN from the Daxing dataset is 46.39%, with an improvement of 0.62% over the baselines, and the Conn index of MS-AGAN on DeepGlobe is 70.08%, holding an improvement of 1.73% over CoANet.

10.1609/aaai.v37i4.25589,Human-Instructed Deep Hierarchical Generative Learning for Automated Urban Planning,Wang D.,"The essential task of urban planning is to generate the optimal land-use configuration of a target area. However, traditional urban planning is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Deep generative learning gives us hope that we can automate this planning process and come up with the ideal urban plans. While remarkable achievements have been obtained, they have exhibited limitations in lacking awareness of: 1) the hierarchical dependencies between functional zones and spatial grids; 2) the peer dependencies among functional zones; and 3) human regulations to ensure the usability of generated configurations.","To address these limitations, we develop a novel human-instructed deep hierarchical generative model. We rethink the urban planning generative task from a unique functionality perspective, where we summarize planning requirements into different functionality projections for better urban plan generation. To this end, we develop a three-stage generation process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function. The third stage is to leverage multi-attentions to model the zone-zone peer dependencies of the functionality projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."
10.1117/1.OE.62.6.063101,Enhancing haze removal and super-resolution in real-world images: A cycle generative adversarial network-based approach for synthesizing paired hazy and clear images,Su X.,"Haze significantly impacts various fields, such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and security monitoring. Deep learning has been proven effective in removing haze from images. However, obtaining pixel-aligned hazy and clear paired images in the real world can be challenging. Therefore, synthesized hazed images are often used for training deep networks. These images are typically generated based on parameters such as depth information and atmospheric scattering coefficient.","However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images. This method has broadened the applications of deep learning in haze removal, particularly highlighting its potential in the fields of autonomous driving and smart cities."

It is possible to visualize future landscapes by making sketches and models, but this requires a great deal of skill and effort on the part of the creator. One method for visualizing future landscapes without the need for specialized skills or labor is image generation using deep learning, and a method has been proposed of using deep learning to generate landscape images after demolishing current buildings.

10.7717/PEERJ-CS.1292,Remote sensing image analysis and prediction based on improved Pix2Pix model for water environment protection of smart cities,Wang L.,"Background. As an important part of smart cities, smart water environmental protection has become an important way to solve water environmental pollution problems.","It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities"

10.1080/17512549.2022.2152865,A novel machine learning-based framework for mapping outdoor thermal comfort,Shahrestani S.S.,"Rapid urbanization and global warming have increased heat stress in urban areas. This in turn makes using indoor space more compelling and leads to more energy consumption. Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities.","This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different façade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments. HIGHLIGHTS Machine learning use in outdoor thermal comfort assessment has been investigated. Vegetation, urban geometry, surface albedo, and water bodies have been studied parameters. Vegetation and street orientation have the highest and water bodies have the least impact on outdoor thermal comfort. Pix2pix algorithm implementation could create thermal comfort maps with 96% SSIM."

Currently, performance-based urban and building design relies on a time-consuming numerical simulation process, hindering performance optimization early in the design process.","This paper proposes an automated design process that applies generative adversarial network (GAN) as a surrogate model to accelerate environmental performance-driven urban design. Parameterized urban blocks are designed for random sampling and constructing a numerical simulation database. The GAN model was trained to predict pedestrian level wind (PLW), annual cumulative solar radiation (Radiation) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in real-time. The GAN-based surrogate model is combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve real-time optimization of urban morphology. The results show that on the test set, the pix2pix model using a specific encoding method predicts the R2 of 0.70, 0.86 and 0.80 for PLW, Radiation and UTCI, respectively, while the method can speed up 120–240 times compared to the numerical simulation method. The optimization results show that NSGA-II combined with global averaging pooling achieves the best optimization results. When the number of optimized samples exceeds 174, the proposed method has a time advantage over traditional methods for outdoor environment optimization in urban design."

We analyzed 100 articles to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on how GANs are currently applied to solve challenging tasks in the built environment.

10.1016/j.scs.2022.103976,High-resolution spatial analysis for the air quality regulation service from urban vegetation: A case study of Taipei City,Chen H.S.,"Rapid economic growth has caused air pollution, particularly in city areas. Removing air pollutants generated by various emission sources is crucial to control PM2.5, improve air quality, and maintain human health in high-density urban areas. In response to air pollution, urban vegetation plays an essential role in providing air quality regulation service.","To estimate the air quality regulation service provided by urban vegetation, this study integrated spatial analysis, a dry deposition model, and an atmospheric diffusion model to spatially quantify the air quality regulation service of PM2.5 in Taipei City on a high-resolution scale (30 m × 30 m per spatial unit). The results show that in 2016, total PM2.5 emissions in Taipei City were 1,400.88 tonnes and that urban vegetation removed 18.31 tonnes of PM2.5, with an average PM2.5 removal rate of 0.16 g/m2, and the corresponding PM2.5 concentration improvement value of 0.0136 μg/m3. This finding revealed a significant gap between the amounts of emissions and purifications of PM2.5, the air quality regulation service provided by the urban vegetation in Taipei City remains insufficient. The results of this study not only point out the spatial differences of regulation services and propose a new research framework for quantifying the natural benefits, but also as a guideline for governments to form the auxiliary policies of the urban ecosystem service and facilitate the urban green infrastructure planning."
10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107245,Towards a sustainable monitoring: A self-powered smart transportation infrastructure skin,Zheng Q.,Sustainable monitoring of traffic using clean energy supply has always been a significant problem for engineers.,"In this study, we proposed a self-powered smart transportation infrastructure skin (SSTIS) as an innovative and bionic system for the traffic classification of a smart city. This system incorporated the self-powered flexible sensors with net-zero power consumption based on the Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) and an intelligent analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI). The feasibility of the SSTIS was tested using the full-scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) and the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with a vehicle axle load classification accuracy up to 89.06%. This robust SSTIS was later tested on highway and collected around 869,600 pieces of signals data. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN - Gradient Penalty) was used for data augmentation, due to the imbalanced data of different vehicle types in actual traffic. The overall accuracy for on-road vehicle type classification improved to 81.06% using the convolutional neural network ResNet. Finally, we developed a mobile traffic signal information monitoring system based on cloud platform and Android framework, which enabled engineers to obtain the vehicle axle-load information mobilely. This study is the emerging design and engineering application of the self-powered flexible sensors for smart traffic monitoring, which provides a significant advance for intelligent transportation and smart cities in future."

Several numerical models require, however, heavy computational resources and prolonged simulation time up to several days. This time constraint is specifically crucial for intervention planning in case of accidental or malevolent toxic releases in a city.","In this paper, we propose to use synthetic data generated by a realistic 3-D transport/dispersion simulator, to train a learning framework called MCxM. The latter relies on a sequence of masking and correction operations to progressively apply the spatial constraints and underlying physics of transport and dispersion. The learning phase uses the urban geometry of the French city Grenoble. We then test the effectiveness of the trained MCxM in a different French city: Paris. The results show that the MCxM's forecasts are virtually instantaneous and generalize successfully to unseen conditions."

Despite policy and design implications, realistic projections of future urban landscape changes were primarily obtained based on street-scale design in earlier studies, leaving questions about the successful integration of repurposed urban elements.","This study aimed to formulate design strategies in an incremental fashion applicable to large areas of cities to enhance the connectivity between AVs and existing transportation modes. A conceptual model was built referring to blocks of different forms and functions in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, to extend our designs from the street level to the district level. Urban elements—streets, public spaces and transit systems—were redesigned and merged into the patchwork concept, which links different street and zone types as an efficient system. The above urban design concept proposes the separation of AVs and regular vehicles and adopts unique linkage structures to effectively connect zones assigned to AV usage. The strategies and designs developed in this study contribute to the limited studies on city-scale future AV projections and provide spatial implications as a guideline to address preparations considering AVs in the urban space."

10.1109/ICDMW58026.2022.00028,FastFlow: AI for Fast Urban Wind Velocity Prediction,Low S.J.,"Data-driven approaches, including deep learning, have shown great promise as surrogate models across many domains, including computer vision and natural language pro-cessing. These extend to various areas in sustainability, including for satellite image analysis to obtain information such as land usage and extent of development. An interesting direction for which data-driven methods have not been applied much yet is in the quick quantitative evaluation of urban layouts for planning and design. In particular, urban designs typically involve complex trade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up and/or consideration of urban heat island effect. Hence, it can be beneficial to urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban characteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity, without having to run compu-tationally expensive and time-consuming high-fidelity numerical simulations each time. This fast surrogate can then be potentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including generative models or other gradient-based methods.","Here we present an investigation into the use of convolutional neural networks as a surrogate for urban layout characterization that is typically done via high-fidelity numerical simulation. We then further apply this model towards a first demonstration of its utility for data-driven pedestrian-level wind velocity prediction. The data set in this work comprises results from high-fidelity numerical simulations of wind velocities for a diverse set of realistic urban layouts, based on randomized samples from a real-world, highly built-up urban city. We then provide prediction results obtained from the neural network trained on this data-set, demonstrating test errors of under 0.1 m/s for previously unseen novel urban layouts. We further illustrate how this can be useful for purposes such as rapid evaluation of pedestrian wind velocity for a potential new layout. In addition, it is hoped that this data set will further inspire, facilitate and accelerate research in data-driven urban AI, even as our baseline model facilitates quantitative comparison to future, more innovative methods."

As design and planning functions increasingly overlap, it is the hope that technologies like machine learning and other digital tools will evolve and proliferate to enable designers to employ data-driven analyses in informing a wider range of design decisions.","This chapter proposes a potential use case for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the planning and design process. GANs are used to develop novel impressionistic aerial imagery—or urban impressions—based on a variety of inputs common to practice such as variations of land use and/or land cover. The GANs make extensive use of readily-available, tiled, web-format maps in both their training and prediction. The generated urban impressions were evaluated based on a range of qualitative criteria, including their ability to foster increased dialogue between parties. Additionally, this research included the development of a prototype tool that creates urban impressions based on selected inputs early on in the predesign phase. Ultimately, it is the hope that this prototype “sketch tool” will allow practitioners to use GANs to test out initial “sketched” approaches in planning and design and communicate them to the client for early feedback."

Labeled real data of occlusions is scarce (even in large datasets) and synthetic data leaves a domain gap, making it hard to explicitly model and learn occlusions.","In this work, we present the best of both the real and synthetic worlds for automatic occlusion supervision using a large readily available source of data: time-lapse imagery from stationary webcams observing street intersections over weeks, months, or even years. We introduce a new dataset, Watch and Learn Time-lapse (WALT), consisting of 12 (4K and 1080p) cameras capturing urban environments over a year. We exploit this real data in a novel way to automatically mine a large set of unoccluded objects and then composite them in the same views to generate occlusions. This longitudinal self-supervision is strong enough for an amodal network to learn object-occluder-occluded layer representations. We show how to speed up the discovery of unoccluded objects and relate the confidence in this discovery to the rate and accuracy of training occluded objects. After watching and automatically learning for several days, this approach shows significant performance improvement in detecting and segmenting occluded people and vehicles, over human-supervised amodal approaches."

The building morphology and blocks constitute the simulation cases and are simulated considering seven cities in four thermal climate zones. The climate characteristic parameters and geographic location information of the cities are used as the input for the simulation to obtain a regression model that can be applied in most areas of China to predict the shading effect. Grasshopper and EnergyPlus were used to develop the physical models and estimate the building loads for stand-alone buildings or buildings in a network. The results demonstrate that the influence of shading varies significantly under different scenarios, and cooling loads can be over-estimated up to 45% and heating load under-estimated up to 21% in some cities such as Lanzhou. Using the distribution range of 95% relative errors to evaluate the reliability and generalization of the model, the results show that the established support vector regression can effectively calculate the shading effect. The proposed method can quickly estimate the building energy demand by considering the shading effect, which is expected to provide technical support for urban design and energy planning."

The biggest impedance to creating such ML tools is lack of viable data - without the data, the tools cannot be created - yet it is not feasible to wait for several years' worth of good data before creating the tools.","Here we present a solution to this problem: the use of a digital twin to generate synthetic data. This approach is viable even when there is no existing data, but when expert knowledge about the relationship between systems exist. To achieve this, we develop a new agent-based synthetic data generator (ASDG) and explore a case study with a corporate housing and luxury alternate accommodation marketplace called TheSqua.re. We show that unlimited quantities of realistic data can be automatically generated, including data for different scenarios, and that it can be used by Machine Learning to discover the underlying correlations."

An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured three-dimensional (3D) virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include clouds, which degrade image quality. These clouds can be removed by using a generative adversarial network (GAN), which leads to improvements in training quality.","Therefore, the objective of this research was to propose a method for automatically generating building mask images by using 3D virtual models with textured aerial photographs. In this study, using GAN to remove clouds in aerial photographs improved training quality. A model trained on datasets generated by the proposed method was able to detect buildings in aerial photographs with IoU = 0.651."

10.1109/JIOT.2021.3060815,Cost-Effective Active Sparse Urban Sensing: Adversarial Autoencoder Approach,Zhu K.,"The ever-expanding applications of mobile crowdsensing have made scalable environment sensing possible by exploiting the power of ubiquitous smart devices. Nevertheless, the implementation of sensing applications in urban scale meets serious challenges in terms of sensing costs and quality. For example, data sparsity will arise due to sensing ability and cost, and the measurements could contain noise or errors. Therefore, missing data inference with low-quality measurements is critical. To tackle these challenges, we design a low-cost crowdsensing system by missing data inference incorporating with active sensing grids selection. Specifically, an adversarial autoencoder (AAE)-based scheme is proposed for missing data inference. This model applies VAE to learn latent variables and generates full data and further utilizes the adversarial nets to play a min-max game with the autoencoder. Furthermore, an active learning-based method is designed to iteratively select sensing grids to further reduce the cost. The proposed scheme can handle large missing rate, both random and block missing patterns, and is robust against measurement noise. Comprehensive experiments based on three data sets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system.","The ever-expanding applications of mobile crowdsensing have made scalable environment sensing possible by exploiting the power of ubiquitous smart devices.

As a result, the effective modeling and organization of texture data become an important issue in geographic information science community.","Hence, this paper proposes the Fractal Viewing Distance (FVD) multi-resolution texture data generation and organization method for 3D city building photorealistic mapping. First, a fractal compression method based on the self-similarity and self-affine properties of texture is developed, which compresses and stores texture and 3D building model data in the database. Second, the corresponding texture is created and organized according to the visual distance and the visibility of the target facade. When the visual distance meets the texture calling condition and the target facade is visible, the texture data is iteratively decompressed, and the number of texture resampling is determined to create multi-resolution texture data. A texture index is established and stored in a database according to the relationship between various types of 3D building model data. When the visual distance does not meet the texture calling condition, but the target facade is visible, the building facade texture is represented using a colored texture tree created in this paper. The method smooths the texture and divides it into different rectangles as nodes based on the color difference, and then a colored texture tree is built to store these nodes. In the process of model visualization, the nodes are merged to represent the texture. Finally, the corresponding texture is selected according to the angle of view and distance, representing the dynamic and smooth visualization of the 3D model. The experimental field consisting of a total of 5290 texture data, located in Lixia District, Jinan City, Shandong Province is selected to validate the method we proposed, which occupies a total size of 6.1G. The results demonstrate that when the number of decompressing iterations reaches around 8 or 10, the peak ratio of signal to noise of each texture tends to be stable. The average memory consumption is approximately 54.7%, and the frame rate for building façade mapping is at about 42 frames per second. Compared with 3ds Max and SketchUp Pro, the proposed method reduces the memory occupation by about 36.5 % and 49.1%, respectively, and increase the frame rate approximately by 7 % and 10.9 %, respectively. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a good balance between rendering efficiency and visual quality of 3D building model. The method proposed in this paper can provide an effective scientific support for the establishment of smart city."

Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems.","In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results.

10.1007/978-981-16-2629-6_4,"Experimenting the Impact of Pedestrianisation on Urban Pollution Using Tangible Agent-Based Simulations: Application to Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi, Vietnam",Brugière A.,"The development of permanent or temporary pedestrian areas, whether for leisure or to decrease air pollution, has become an integral part of urban planning in numerous cities around the world. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, began to implement its first area, around the iconic Hoan Kiem lake, a few years ago. In most of cases, however, road closure is likely to deport traffic to nearby neighbourhoods with the consequences of intensifying congestion and, possibly, increasing air pollution in these areas. Because this outcome might appear counter-intuitive to most stakeholders, it is becoming more and more necessary to analyse, assess and share the impacts of these developments in terms of traffic and pollution shifts before implementing them. In this project, we used the GAMA platform to build an agent-based model that simulates the traffic, its emissions of air pollutants, and the diffusion of these pollutants in the district of Hoan Kiem. This simulation has been designed so as to serve either as a decision support tool for local authorities or as an awareness-raising tool for the general public: thanks to its display on a physical 3D model of the district, people can effectively and naturally interact with it at public venues. Although more accurate data and more realistic diffusion models are necessary and will need further research in the future, the simulation is already able to reflect traffic and air pollution peaks during rush hours, allowing residents and developers to understand the impact of pedestrianization on air quality in different scenarios.","The development of permanent or temporary pedestrian areas, whether for leisure or to decrease air pollution, has become an integral part of urban planning in numerous cities around the world. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, began to implement its first area, around the iconic Hoan Kiem lake, a few years ago. In most of cases, however, road closure is likely to deport traffic to nearby neighbourhoods with the consequences of intensifying congestion and, possibly, increasing air pollution in these areas.

10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100659,Identification of linkages between urban heat Island magnitude and urban rainfall modification by use of causal discovery algorithms,Liu J.,"This study is the first, purely data-driven technique to assess the classical urban climatological problem of the relation between urban heat island (UHI) and urban rainfall modification. Urban areas affect regional climate. This knowledge is based on studies involving observations or process-scale models. These studies, while important for understanding the dynamic processes, come at a cost (time, resources). In this paper, we explore the potential of using statistical algorithms for conducting such urban climate studies. Taking an example of the UHI and rainfall dataset, we test six different causal discovery algorithms in their search for a relation between UHI and urban rainfall. This study aims to highlight that a causal algorithm can provide us computationally efficient results that can be useful for urban rainfall studies. In terms of the causal techniques, the constraint versus score-based models provided different causal links, and the score-based models were found to be more realistic (IMaGES). The results provide a promise for the simple, data-centric models to be used as a screening mechanism for identifying cities and cases to study the influence of urban rainfall modification; and, can prove to be useful for further in-depth analysis using computationally intense numerical models, or field studies.","This study is the first, purely data-driven technique to assess the classical urban climatological problem of the relation between urban heat island (UHI) and urban rainfall modification.

10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIII-B2-2020-383-2020,LONG-SHORT SKIP CONNECTIONS in DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS for DSM REFINEMENT,Bittner K.,"Detailed digital surface models (DSMs) from space-borne sensors are the key to successful solutions for many remote sensing problems, like environmental disaster simulations, change detection in rural and urban areas, 3D urban modeling for city planning and management, etc. Traditional methodologies, e.g., stereo matching, used to generate photogrammetric DSMs from stereo imagery, usually deliver low-quality results due to the matching errors in homogeneous areas or the lack of information when observing the scene under different viewing angles. This makes the tasks related to building reconstruction very challenging since in most cases it is difficult to recognize the type of roofs, especially if overlaid with trees.","This work represents a continuation of research regarding the automatic optimization of building geometries in photogrammetric DSMs with half-meter resolution and introduces an improved generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture which allows to reconstruct complete and detailed building structures without neglecting even low-rise urban constructions. The generative part of the network is constructed in a way that it simultaneously processes height and intensity information, and combines short and long skip connections within one architecture. To improve different aspects of the surface, several loss terms are used, the contributions of which are automatically balanced during training. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve two goals without any manual intervention: improve the roof surfaces by making them more planar and also recognize and optimize even small residential buildings which are hard to detect."
10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00109,Phytogan: Unpaired dead-to-live phytoplankton translation,Han S.,"Detecting phytoplankton that causes red tide is an urgent task. However, the live phytoplankton images are scarce and difficult to obtain.","This paper aims to discover a mapping between live and dead phytoplankton. We propose PhytoGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network for the unpaired dead-tolive phytoplankton translation. We design a new PCALoss by extracting the principal component of the image to enhance the contour of the generated image. The addition of PCALoss can significantly improve the integrity of images. The experiments are carried out on the existing phytoplankton dataset. A series of experiments are discussed in the paper to demonstrate the performance of the domain transformation and the proposed loss functions. The experimental results indicate that PhytoGAN can produce more integral images of phytoplankton while completing the domain transformation compared with the existing methods."
10.1109/TGRS.2018.2889109,A novel unsupervised sample collection method for urban land-cover mapping using landsat imagery,Li J.,"Land-cover mapping over urban areas using Landsat imagery has attracted considerable attention in recent years as it can promptly and accurately reflect the biophysical composition status of the urban landscape and allow further applications such as urban planning and risk management. However, due to the large diversity across different urban landscapes, adequate training sample collection for urban area mapping is both challenging and time-consuming.","In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised sample collection method for mapping urban areas using Landsat imagery. Specifically, the idea is to select reliable, representative, and diverse training samples from the images in a two-stage and iterative manner, based on a set of spectral indices (vegetation, impervious surface, soil, water). To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, a synthetic data set was designed and a series of Landsat images over 39 representative cities from different biomes across the world was employed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was quantitatively validated by assessing the quality of the automatically collected samples and the accuracy of the mapping results. In terms of the mapping performance, the proposed automatic approach can achieve a comparable mapping accuracy to supervised classification with manually collected samples. On the basis of the freely accessed Landsat data, the proposed approach demonstrates a promising potential for automatic large-scale (i.e., global) mapping over urban areas."
10.1080/15481603.2018.1533680,Simulation of landscape spatial layout evolution in rural-urban fringe areas: a case study of Ganjingzi District,Yang J.,"In recent years, the rapid expansion of urban spaces has accelerated the mutual evolution of landscape types. Analyzing and simulating spatio-temporal dynamic features of urban landscape can help to reveal its driving mechanisms and facilitate reasonable planning of urban land resources.","The purpose of this study was to design a hybrid cellular automata model to simulate dynamic change in urban landscapes. The model consists of four parts: a geospatial partition, a Markov chain (MC), a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), and cellular automata (CA). This study employed multivariate land use data for the period 2000–2015 to conduct spatial clustering for the Ganjingzi District and to simulate landscape status evolution via a divisional composite cellular automaton model. During the period of 2000–2015, construction land and forest land areas in Ganjingzi District increased by 19.43% and 15.19%, respectively, whereas farmland, garden lands, and other land areas decreased by 43.42%, 52.14%, and 75.97%, respectively. Land use conversion potentials in different sub-regions show different characteristics in space. The overall land-change prediction accuracy for the subarea-composite model is 3% higher than that of the non-partitioned model, and misses are reduced by 3.1%. Therefore, by integrating geospatial zoning and the MLP-ANN hybrid method, the land type conversion rules of different zonings can be obtained, allowing for more effective simulations of future urban land use change. The hybrid cellular automata model developed here will provide a reference for urban planning and policy formulation."
10.3390/ijgi8030154,Geographical area network-structural health monitoring utility computing model,Tariq H.,"In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena and geographical expansion, there is a pressing need for a more effective environment logging for a better management and urban planning.","This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM."
10.1007/978-3-030-27157-2_13,Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for Urban Green Space Mapping in Urbanizing Indian Cities,Lahoti S.,"Geospatial data of urban green spaces (UGS) is mostly unavailable for emerging Indian cities, which effects their provisioning, maintenance and monitoring. In absence of spatial data, the strategic vision and comprehensive urban planning to enhance urban environment of cities witnessing transition are compromised. Owing to the direct link between urban environment and wellbeing of urban dweller, it is utmost important to address this gap and support planning process by providing the required data set of desired spatial and temporal scale. Though satellite imagery and remotely sensed data are widely used in environmental studies, for urban greens the spatial resolution of images is inapt. In addition, high cost acts as a barrier towards its wide scale application.","Thus, the study reviews current state of literature on application of UAVs for spatial data generation to allow integrated analysis to support urban planning process. A case example of Nagpur city is presented to highlight specific direct applications. The review finds UAVs as cost effective and efficient tool for images with relevant resolution for planners and decision makers. While regulation hinder its wide applicability, the cost component, flexibility, timely monitoring and accessibility weighs UAVs as suitable tool for data collection in urban areas. As use of UAVs in urban areas is still limited, the study recommends more experimentations and trials to arrive at set methodology which could help in mapping of UGS and other qualitative data gathering to support urban planning and urban greening."
