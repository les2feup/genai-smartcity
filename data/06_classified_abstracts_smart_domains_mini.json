    "abstract": "Building rooftop extraction has been applied in various fields, such as cartography, urban planning, automatic driving, and intelligent city construction. Automatic building detection and extraction algorithms using high spatial resolution aerial images can provide precise location and geometry information, significantly reducing time, costs, and labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer, have robust local or global feature extraction ability, achieving advanced performance in intelligent interpretation compared with conventional methods. However, buildings often exhibit scale variation, spectral heterogeneity, and similarity with complex geometric shapes. Hence, the building rooftop extraction results exist fragmentation and lack spatial details using these methods. To address these issues, this study developed a multi-scale global perceptron network based on Transformer and CNN using novel encoder-decoders for enhancing contextual representation of buildings. Specifically, an improved multi-head-attention encoder is employed by constructing multi-scale tokens to enhance global semantic correlations. Meanwhile, the context refinement decoder is developed and synergistically uses high-level semantic representation and shallow features to restore spatial details. Overall, quantitative analysis and visual experiments confirmed that the proposed model is more efficient and superior to other state-of-the-art methods, with a 95.18% F1 score on the WHU dataset and a 93.29% F1 score on the Massub dataset.",

    "abstract": "Problem: Modernizing and standardizing place names and addresses is a key challenge in the development of smart cities. Purpose: This paper proposes a solution to address matching challenges, such as incomplete descriptions, reversed word order, and the diverse descriptions often found in Chinese addresses. Method: Leveraging the hierarchical structure of Chinese addresses, this study introduces the interactive address matching graph attention model (IAMGAM). In the IAMGAM, an attention-based feature interaction method (AFIM) is employed. To reflect the hierarchical nature of address elements, a directed graph is used to model the address data, and the model is trained and tested using a graph attention mechanism. Results: Experiments demonstrate that the IAMGAM achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 99.61%. Compared with the existing address matching methods, the IAMGAM improves the accuracy by 0.66% to 2.57%, and the F1-score by 0.68% to 2.55%, outperforming baseline models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component within the model. Furthermore, when fine-tuned using ChatGLM2-6B, the results show that the IAMGAM still outperforms ChatGLM2-6B. Conclusion: IAMGAM demonstrates excellent performance in Chinese address matching tasks, and the Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods, such as ChatGLM2-6B, show great potential for future development in this area.",

    "abstract": "Distributed multivariate time series anomaly detection is widely-used in industrial equipment monitoring, financial risk management, and smart cities. Although Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant interest and achieved decent performance in various scenarios, most existing FL-based distributed anomaly detection methods still face challenges including: inadequate detection performance in global model, insufficient essential features extraction caused by the fragmentation of local time series, and lack for practical anomaly localization. To address these challenges, we propose an Unsupervised Federated Hypernetwork Method for Distributed Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis (uFedHy-DisMTSADD). Specifically, we introduce a federated hypernetwork architecture that effectively mitigates the heterogeneity and fluctuations in distributed environments while protecting client data privacy. Then, we adopt the Series Conversion Normalization Transformer (SC Nor-Transformer) to tackle the timing bias due to model aggregation through series conversion. Series normalization improves the temporal dependence of capturing subsequences. Finally, uFedHy-DisMTSADD simultaneously localizes the root cause of the anomaly by reconstructing the anomaly scores obtained from each subsequence. We performed an extensive evaluation on nine datasets, in which uFedHy-DisMTSADD outperformed the existing state-of-the-art baseline average F1 score by 9.19% and the average AUROC by 2.41%. Moreover, the average localization fault accuracy of uFedHy-DisMTSADD is 9.23% higher than that of the optimal baseline method.

This research introduces a novel two-stage stochastic approach for distribution network expansion planning in smart grids with high renewable energy penetration, addressing uncertainty, risk, and distributed generators' remuneration. Key contributions include: the incorporation of third-party generation owners' economic remuneration into a risk-based stochastic model; the use of conditional value-at-risk to manage uncertainty and extreme events, with a detailed analysis of cost evolution for various confidence levels and risk aversion parameters; the optimization of energy storage systems sizing and placement, alongside the location and type of new power lines and substation transformers, ensuring a reliable and radial network topology; and the integration of multiple factors, including uncertainty, risk aversion, ESS allocation, remuneration, and reliability, into a unified model that ensures optimal network design under technical constraints. Tested on a 180-bus network in Leiria, Portugal and on a 13-bus smart city mockup from Salamanca, Spain, the approach proved economically viable, reducing extreme scenario costs by up to 34 % through CVaR-based risk management, and demonstrating its potential for sustainable, risk-averse network expansion.",

    "abstract": "In the construction of smart cities in the new era, traffic prediction is an important component. Precise traffic flow prediction faces significant challenges due to spatial heterogeneity, dynamic correlations, and uncertainty. Most existing methods typically learn from a single spatial or temporal perspective, or at best combine the two in a limited dual-perspective manner, which limits their ability to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Fusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MSTDFGRN) to address these limitations. The core idea is to learn dynamic spatial dependencies alongside both short- and long-term temporal patterns through multi-view learning. First, we introduce a multi-view spatial convolution module that dynamically fuses static and adaptive graphs in multiple subspaces to learn intrinsic and potential spatial dependencies of nodes. Simultaneously, in the temporal view, we design both short-range and long-range recurrent networks to aggregate spatial domain knowledge of nodes at multiple granularities and capture forward and backward temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we design a spatio-temporal attention model that applies an attention mechanism to each node, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on four real traffic flow datasets demonstrate MSTDFGRN's excellent predictive accuracy. Specifically, compared to the Spatial–Temporal Graph Attention Gated Recurrent Transformer Network model, our method improves the MAE by 4.69% on the PeMS08 dataset.",

    "contribution": "In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Fusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MSTDFGRN) to address these limitations. The core idea is to learn dynamic spatial dependencies alongside both short- and long-term temporal patterns through multi-view learning. First, we introduce a multi-view spatial convolution module that dynamically fuses static and adaptive graphs in multiple subspaces to learn intrinsic and potential spatial dependencies of nodes. Simultaneously, in the temporal view, we design both short-range and long-range recurrent networks to aggregate spatial domain knowledge of nodes at multiple granularities and capture forward and backward temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we design a spatio-temporal attention model that applies an attention mechanism to each node, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on four real traffic flow datasets demonstrate MSTDFGRN's excellent predictive accuracy. Specifically, compared to the Spatial–Temporal Graph Attention Gated Recurrent Transformer Network model, our method improves the MAE by 4.69% on the PeMS08 dataset.",
    "introduction": "In the construction of smart cities in the new era, traffic prediction is an important component. Precise traffic flow prediction faces significant challenges due to spatial heterogeneity, dynamic correlations, and uncertainty. Most existing methods typically learn from a single spatial or temporal perspective, or at best combine the two in a limited dual-perspective manner, which limits their ability to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships.",

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

We propose crash likelihood prediction as an effective strategy to proactively prevent intersection crashes. So far, no reliable models have been developed for intersections that effectively account for the variation in crash types and the cyclical nature of Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) and traffic flow. Moreover, the limited research available has primarily relied on sampling techniques to address data imbalance, without exploring alternative solutions. We develop an anomaly detection framework by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to predict the likelihood of cycle-level crashes at intersections. The model is built using high-resolution event data extracted from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM), including SPaT and traffic flow insights from 11 intersections in Seminole County, Florida. Our framework demonstrates a sensitivity of 76% in predicting crash events using highly imbalanced crash data along with real-world SPaT and traffic data, highlighting its potential for deployment at smart intersections. Overall, the results provide a roadmap for city-wide implementation at smart intersections, with the potential for multiple real-time solutions for impending crashes.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet of Things devices have progressively deployed in various applications including smart cities, intelligent transportation, healthcare, and agriculture. However, this widespread adaptation of the Internet of Things networks has been vulnerable to several attacks. Lack of security protocols, unauthorized access, and improper device updates lead the Internet of Things environment to several attacks, which impact network security and confidentiality of users. This paper develops an innovative approach that integrates Edge Implicit Weighting and Aggregated Graph Transformer architecture for accurate and timely intrusion detection. The proposed technique aggregates information from both one-hop and two-hop neighbors to derive immediate and extended relational context thereby improving the detection of complex attacks. This approach designs an Edge Implicit Weighting mechanism that allows the model to prioritize structurally significant relationships and enhance the accuracy of attack detection. The multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the detection of relevant patterns even in highly variable traffic scenarios. Further, the proposed framework incorporates the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to generate synthetic samples of minority classes to reduce class imbalance problems and attain balanced detection performance across all classes. The performance of the proposed detection technique is analyzed using multiple datasets with standard evaluation parameters. The proposed technique achieves outstanding performance results including an accuracy of 98.87% and a recall of 98.36%. From this experimental validation, it's clear that the proposed framework provides robust performance under diverse network conditions and handles imbalanced data effectively.",

    "abstract": "The intelligent design of shear wall structures is a critical aspect of smart construction, with a high demand for research and applications. Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart cities (SCs) rely on free-flow services streamlined by artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms.

Existing approaches to smart city resource distribution rely on static thresholds or reactive responses, which are not always sufficient. These approaches may limit system performance and scalability in dynamic IoT environments owing to increased energy consumption, postponed resource allocation, and frequent device failures. This article introduces a Concerted Resource Management (CRM) using the Leveled Reinforcement Training (LRT) method. The proposed method accurately identifies cost-complex and high energy-consuming sharing intervals based on service response time and device failure. The reinforcement learning and training concerts both energy and device incorporations for SC applications based on its demand. This process requires leveled training in resource management, from energy depletion to device activeness. The interrupted sessions are identified using resource allocation failures, and the active resources with optimal energy expenses are selected to pursue resource management. The training method thus identifies the demands based on independent or concerted resource allocations to mitigate the management constraints in an SC environment. This proposed method reduces the resource constraint-based waiting for allocations and allocation failures in any SC application services. Under the varying devices, the following is observed: Improvements: 9.1% (Allocation Rate), 10% (Device Detection), 11.88% (Constraint Mitigation— Energy), 9.06% (Constraint Mitigation—Resource Allocation); Reduced: 8.01% (Allocation Failure), 9.64% (Waiting Time).",

    "abstract": "Highlights: What are the main findings? For smart city management, LLM-based multi-agent systems achieve 94–99% accuracy in routing urban queries and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLMs (0.30–0.38). Achievement of high scores in routing queries and response accuracy is possible with middle-size LLM models rather than the biggest LLM models. What is the implication of the main findings? The multi-agent LLM approach enables efficient processing of complex urban planning tasks while maintaining high relevance in responses, making it practical for real-world city management applications. LLM agents can effectively augment human decision making in urban planning by reducing task completion time from days to hours while maintaining accuracy and accountability in complex scenarios. This study investigates the implementation of LLM agents in smart city management, leveraging both the inherent language processing abilities of LLMs and the distributed problem solving capabilities of multi-agent systems for the improvement of urban decision making processes. A multi-agent system architecture combines LLMs with existing urban information systems to process complex queries and generate contextually relevant responses for urban planning and management. The research is focused on three main hypotheses testing: (1) LLM agents’ capability for effective routing and processing diverse urban queries, (2) the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology in improving response accuracy when working with local knowledge and regulations, and (3) the impact of integrating LLM agents with existing urban information systems. Our experimental results, based on a comprehensive validation dataset of 150 question–answer pairs, demonstrate significant improvements in decision support capabilities. The multi-agent system achieved pipeline selection accuracy of 94–99% across different models, while the integration of RAG technology improved response accuracy by 17% for strategic development queries and 55% for service accessibility questions. The combined use of document databases and service APIs resulted in the highest performance metrics (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLM responses (0.30–0.38). Using St. Petersburg’s Digital Urban Platform as a testbed, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach to create integrated city management systems with support complex urban decision making processes. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced urban management by providing empirical evidence of LLM agents’ effectiveness in processing heterogeneous urban data and supporting strategic planning decisions. Our findings suggest that LLM-based multi-agent systems can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of urban decision making while maintaining high relevance in responses.",

    "abstract": "Highlights: What are the main findings? Smart Cities as Hyper-Connected Digital Environments generate large and diverse data streams and repositories that do not consistently translate into insights and decisions. A Responsible AI Hyper-Automation framework with Generative AI agents is developed and evaluated to address these complex challenges. What are the implications of the main findings? The developed AI framework is effective when grounded on five core technical capabilities with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automated agentic AI that feeds into human-in-the-loop processes. The framework provides a prototypical setting for university cities of the future to provide direction, guidance, and standards for sustainable and safe smart cities of the future. Smart cities are Hyper-Connected Digital Environments (HCDEs) that transcend the boundaries of natural, human-made, social, virtual, and artificial environments. Human activities are no longer confined to a single environment as our presence and interactions are represented and interconnected across HCDEs. The data streams and repositories of HCDEs provide opportunities for the responsible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that generates unique insights into the constituent environments and the interplay across constituents. The translation of data into insights poses several complex challenges originating in data generation and then propagating through the computational layers to decision outcomes. To address these challenges, this article presents the design and development of a Hyper-Automated AI framework with Generative AI agents for sustainable smart cities. The framework is empirically evaluated in the living lab setting of a ‘University City of the Future’. The developed AI framework is grounded on the core capabilities of acquisition, preparation, orchestration, dissemination, and retrospection, with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automation of these AI capabilities using Generative AI. Hyper-automation output feeds into a human-in-the-loop process prior to decision-making outcomes. More broadly, this framework aims to provide a validated pathway for university cities of the future to take up the role of prototypes that deliver evidence-based guidelines for the development and management of sustainable smart cities.",

    "abstract": "With the trends of technology convergence and technology interdisciplinarity, technology-field (TF) resolution and classification of patents have gradually been challenged. Whether for patent applicants or for patent examiners, more precisely labeling the TF for a certain patent is important for technological searches. However, determining the TF of a patent may be difficult and may even involve the strategic behavior of patenting, which can cause noise in patent classification systems (PCSs). In addition, some specific patents could contain more TFs than claimed or be assigned questionable IPC codes; subsequently, in a regular search for technology/patents, information could be missed. Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-LSTM, BERT and GPT-4 etc. Therefore, the proposed MLR model with a customized loss function could be moderately effective for patent classification within a specific technology theme, could have implications for patent classification and the TF resolution of patents, and could further enrich methodologies for patent mining and informetrics based on artificial intelligence (AI).",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction of surrounding traffic participants is vital for the driving safety of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs). It has been enabled with the help of the availability of multi-sensor information collected by ICVs. For accurately predicting the future movements of traffic agents, it is crucial to subtlety model the inter-agent interaction. However, existing works focus on the correlations between agents and the map information while neglecting the importance of directly modeling the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions, the direct modeling of which is beneficial for the representation of agent behaviors. Against this background, we propose to model the hyper-relational interaction, which incorporates map elements into the inter-agent interaction. To tackle the hyper-relational interaction, we propose a novel Hyper-relational Multi-modal Trajectory Prediction (HyperMTP) approach. Specifically, a hyper-relational driving graph is first constructed and the hyper-relational interaction is represented as the hyperedge, directly connecting to various nodes (i.e., agents and map elements). Then a structure-aware embedding initialization technique is developed to obtain unbiased initial embeddings. Afterward, hypergraph dual-attention networks are designed to capture correlations between graph elements while retaining the hyper-relational structure. Finally, a heterogeneous Transformer is devised to further capture the correlations between agents’ states and their corresponding hyper-relational interactions. Experimental results show that HyperMTP consistently outperforms the best-performing baseline with an average improvement of 4.8% across two real-world datasets. Moreover, HyperMTP also boosts the interpretability of trajectory prediction by quantifying the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions.",

    "abstract": "Building type information indicates the functional properties of buildings and plays a crucial role in smart city development and urban socioeconomic activities. Existing methods for classifying building types often face challenges in accurately distinguishing buildings between types while maintaining well-delineated boundaries, especially in complex urban environments. This study introduces a novel framework, i.e., CNN-Transformer cross-attention feature fusion network (CTCFNet), for building type classification from very high resolution remote sensing images. CTCFNet integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers using an interactive cross-encoder fusion module that enhances semantic feature learning and improves classification accuracy in complex scenarios. We develop an adaptive collaboration optimization module that applies human visual attention mechanisms to enhance the feature representation of building types and boundaries simultaneously. To address the scarcity of datasets in building type classification, we create two new datasets, i.e., the urban building type (UBT) dataset and the town building type (TBT) dataset, for model evaluation. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that CTCFNet outperforms popular CNNs, Transformers, and dual-encoder methods in identifying building types across various regions, achieving the highest mean intersection over union of 78.20% and 77.11%, F1 scores of 86.83% and 88.22%, and overall accuracy of 95.07% and 95.73% on the UBT and TBT datasets, respectively. We conclude that CTCFNet effectively addresses the challenges of high interclass similarity and intraclass inconsistency in complex scenes, yielding results with well-delineated building boundaries and accurate building types.",

    "contribution": "This study introduces a novel framework, i.e., CNN-Transformer cross-attention feature fusion network (CTCFNet), for building type classification from very high resolution remote sensing images. CTCFNet integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers using an interactive cross-encoder fusion module that enhances semantic feature learning and improves classification accuracy in complex scenarios. We develop an adaptive collaboration optimization module that applies human visual attention mechanisms to enhance the feature representation of building types and boundaries simultaneously. To address the scarcity of datasets in building type classification, we create two new datasets, i.e., the urban building type (UBT) dataset and the town building type (TBT) dataset, for model evaluation. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that CTCFNet outperforms popular CNNs, Transformers, and dual-encoder methods in identifying building types across various regions, achieving the highest mean intersection over union of 78.20% and 77.11%, F1 scores of 86.83% and 88.22%, and overall accuracy of 95.07% and 95.73% on the UBT and TBT datasets, respectively. We conclude that CTCFNet effectively addresses the challenges of high interclass similarity and intraclass inconsistency in complex scenes, yielding results with well-delineated building boundaries and accurate building types.",
    "introduction": "Building type information indicates the functional properties of buildings and plays a crucial role in smart city development and urban socioeconomic activities. Existing methods for classifying building types often face challenges in accurately distinguishing buildings between types while maintaining well-delineated boundaries, especially in complex urban environments.",

    "abstract": "Fire detection has held stringent importance in computer vision for over half a century. The development of early fire detection strategies is pivotal to the realization of safe and smart cities, inhabitable in the future. However, the development of optimal fire and smoke detection models is hindered by limitations like publicly available datasets, lack of diversity, and class imbalance. In this work, we explore the possible ways forward to overcome these challenges posed by available datasets. We study the impact of a class-balanced dataset to improve the fire detection capability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-based models and propose the use of generative models for data augmentation, as a future work direction. First, a comparative analysis of two prominent object detection architectures, You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) and YOLOv8 has been carried out using a balanced dataset, where both models have been evaluated across various evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP). The results are compared to other recent fire detection models, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed YOLOv8 architecture as trained on our balanced dataset. Next, a fractal dimension analysis gives a deeper insight into the repetition of patterns in fire, and the effectiveness of the results has been demonstrated by a windowing-based inference approach. The proposed Slicing-Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) improves the fire and smoke detection capability of YOLOv8 for real-life applications with a significantly improved mAP performance over a strict confidence threshold. YOLOv8 with SAHI inference gives a mAP:50-95 improvement of more than 25% compared to the base YOLOv8 model. The study also provides insights into future work direction by exploring the potential of generative models like deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and diffusion models like stable diffusion, for data augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Joint communication and sensing (JC&S) is emerging as a key component in 5G and 6G networks, enabling the dynamic adaptation to environmental changes and enhancing contextual awareness for optimized communication. By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC&S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhancing power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors such as smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes multihead attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC&S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid urbanization and development of the social economy have led to a growing focus on public safety issues. Governments across the world are increasingly promoting the construction of smart cities and intelligent security systems to safeguard the lives and property of citizens and maintain social stability. Person re-identification (ReID) is an essential technology for building smart cities, with significant implications for security monitoring and criminal investigation applications. The goal of person re-identification is to accurately identify specific individuals captured under different cameras. However, due to intra-class differences resulting from various factors such as illumination, viewpoint, occlusion, and pose, person re-identification remains a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Although existing fully supervised person re-identification methods have made significant progress, the scarcity of data and labels poses a bottleneck for further improving model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce a more complex and diverse synthetic dataset with easy-to-obtain labels for auxiliary training, and propose a novel camera-aware asymmetric adversarial learning (CAAL) method that overcomes intra-class variation among multiple cameras and the domain-shift between real data and synthetic data, enabling the learning of camera-invariant feature representations from diverse data sources. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of misleading information carried by synthetic datasets and prevent the model from overfitting to synthetic data during adversarial training, we propose using an auxiliary network trained on real-world data to constrain the training of the backbone network. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "One of the challenges of the Internet of Things and smart cities is energy consumption and energy theft. An accurate approach to predicting energy consumption and detecting energy theft in smart cities increases efficiency and energy efficiency. Forecasting energy consumption makes energy production based on the needs of consumers, and detecting energy theft makes energy consumption forecasting models more accurate. In this manuscript, in the first step, the data set is balanced using the generative adversarial network based on game theory and the synthetic minority oversampling based on sample density method. In the second step, the basic features of the samples are selected with the Namib beetle optimization (NBO) algorithm to reduce the input of the CNN-LSTM model. In the third step, the hyperparameters of the CNN-LSTM model are optimized to reduce the prediction and classification error rate with the NBO algorithm. In the Benin Electricity Company dataset, the proposed method has fewer errors in predicting energy consumption than the LSTM, GRU, ARIMA-LSTM, and ARIMA-GRU methods. On the Individual Household Electric-Power Consumption dataset, the proposed method provides lower energy consumption prediction errors than convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and CNN-LSTM. The NBO algorithm optimizer CNN-LSTM hyperparameters more accurately than Coati optimization algorithm, jellyfish search optimization, Harris hawks optimization (HHO), and African vultures optimization algorithm. Experiments on the State Grid Corporation of China dataset showed that the proposed method's accuracy, sensitivity, and precision in predicting energy theft are 98.93, 98.32, and 96.78%. The proposed method is more accurate than CNN, DeepCNN, CNN-LSTM, and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) method.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution remote sensing images provide detailed surface information and are extensively utilized in urban planning, geographic monitoring, and smart city applications. Semantic segmentation, a crucial image analysis method, assigns pixel-level dense labels for scene understanding. However, this task faces challenges such as numerous small objects, complex shapes, detailed edge handling, and the effective fusion of multi-scale features. Existing methods often struggle to balance global information and local details, resulting in limited segmentation accuracy and efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel network architecture named FAttFormer, which leverages the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Within this architecture, we introduce two key modules: the Feature Attention Refinement Module (FARM) and the Multi-Scale Hybrid Attention (MSHA) module. The FAttFormer network is designed to significantly improve semantic segmentation accuracy and efficiency through multi-level and multi-scale feature fusion and refinement. Specifically, the FARM module focuses on effectively integrating encoder and decoder features to handle small objects and complex edges. The MSHA module enhances the ability to capture and integrate global and local information at different scales, further refining segmentation results. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that FAttFormer outperforms existing models in segmenting impervious surfaces and buildings, showing significant improvements in accuracy and detail preservation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled researchers to develop tools to monitor real-world events and user behavior using social media platforms. Twitter is particularly useful for gathering invaluable information related to diseases and public health to build real-time disease surveillance systems. Such systems offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the passive, expensive, and time-consuming process of using data from healthcare organizations and hospitals. In this paper, we propose a novel system of TepiSense to automatically perform disease surveillance of epidemic-prone diseases. Our system classifies tweets related to diseases and further identifies 'indication' tweets that highlight the presence of patients. Our system consists of four distinct modules of pre-processor, feature extractor, classifier, and evaluator. TepiSense compares the performance of 3 feature extraction techniques, 9 machine/deep learning models, and 3 Large Language Models (LLMs). To test the performance of our system, we build a dataset of Twitter Epidemic Surveillance Corpus (TESC) containing 23.9K English and 13K labelled Urdu tweets related to six diseases: COVID19, hepatitis, malaria, flu, dengue, and HIV/AIDS. Our results show that mBERT LLM achieves the highest F-measure values of 0.96 and 0.83 for topic and indication tweets classification, respectively. Furthermore, we compute the correlation of signals generated by our system with real-world cases to test the efficacy on COVID19 disease. We notice that real-world cases have a correlation of 0.58-0.63 with the indication category tweets. Finally, we develop an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to disseminate the analytics of our system. Overall, our system offers a powerful tool for real-time disease surveillance using social media with potential implications for public health policy and decision-making.",

However, traditional video instance segmentation methods face complex models, high computational overheads, and slow segmentation speeds in time-series feature extraction, especially in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, a Dual-Channel and Frequency-Aware Approach for Lightweight Video Instance Segmentation (DCFA-LVIS) is proposed in this paper.

In this paper, we propose a frontend-enhanced time-series prediction network, in which the Multi-Relational Modeling Graph Convolution (MRMGCN) as the frontend-enhanced module, called FEN-MRMGCN. The proposed module captures spatial relationships in dense, multi-route areas by using graph convolution layers based on multi-relational modeling to aggregate spatial information.

Our approach effectively combines external factors, such as traffic congestion and weather conditions, particularly in dense bus route areas, thereby significantly enhancing bus arrival time prediction accuracy. Moreover, we compile and analyze a comprehensive dataset comprising passenger flow, traffic conditions, weather information, and arrival times for both densely populated bus stop areas and regular areas in Macao. Experimental results demonstrate that our frontend-enhanced network achieves a reduction in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 15.36%, 13.44%, and 19.07% compared to traditional time series forecasting models like CNN, LSTM, and Transformer, respectively.

Thus, it is urgent to generate realistic check-in datasets. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) as one of the most capable generation methods is a good choice to achieve this goal. However, generating check-in sequences using DDPM is not an easy feat. The difficulties lie in handling check-in sequences of variable lengths and capturing the correlation from check-in sequences’ distinct characteristics. This paper addresses the challenges by proposing a Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Diffusion Model (STCDM). This model introduces a novel spatio-temporal lossless encoding method that effectively encodes check-in sequences into a suitable format with equal length. Furthermore, we capture the spatio-temporal correlations with two disentangled diffusion modules to reduce the impact of the difference between spatial and temporal characteristics. Finally, we incorporate contrastive learning to enhance the relationship between diffusion modules. We generate four realistic datasets in different scenarios using STCDM and design four metrics for comparison.

    "abstract": "The construction of smart cities contributes to promoting residents' life convenience and sustainable energy development. Despite these advancements, the challenge of fully analyzing and understanding residents' energy usage behaviors leads to inefficient energy use and potential economic losses. Current resident anomaly detection technologies rely on single-source energy data, lacking detailed behavior pattern analysis. Hence, this paper proposes a method to detect abnormal residential water and electricity usage by incorporating multi-source information. Specifically, the correlation between water and electricity usage of residential customers is analyzed based on real metering data and the use of the Copula distribution function, followed by the integration of two innovative data mining techniques to form an anomaly detection framework. The distance correlation coefficient algorithm is used to measure the relevance of users' water and electricity usage data. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is utilized to cluster the distance correlation coefficient for users and detect abnormal users whose distance correlation coefficient curves deviate from the normal user clusters. This multi-source approach avoids single-source bias by improving the data accuracy over one-dimensional methods.

    "abstract": "With the development and widespread application of network information, new technologies led by 5G are emerging, resulting in an increasingly complex network security environment and more diverse attack methods. Unlike traditional networks, 5G networks feature higher connection density, faster data transmission speeds, and lower latency, which are widely applied in scenarios such as smart cities, the Internet of Things, and autonomous driving. The vast amounts of sensitive data generated by these applications become primary targets during the processes of collection and secure sharing, and unauthorized access or tampering could lead to severe data breaches and integrity issues. However, as 5G networks extensively employ encryption technologies to protect data transmission, attackers can hide malicious content within encrypted communication, rendering traditional content-based traffic detection methods ineffective for identifying malicious encrypted traffic. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a malicious encrypted traffic detection method based on reconstructive domain adaptation and adversarial hybrid neural networks. The proposed method integrates generative adversarial networks with ResNet, ResNeXt, and DenseNet to construct an adversarial hybrid neural network, aiming to tackle the challenges of encrypted traffic detection. On this basis, a reconstructive domain adaptation module is introduced to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain, thereby enhancing cross-domain detection capabilities. By preprocessing traffic data from public datasets, the proposed method is capable of extracting deep features from encrypted traffic without the need for decryption. The generator utilizes the adversarial hybrid neural network module to generate realistic malicious encrypted traffic samples, while the discriminator achieves sample classification through high-dimensional feature extraction. Additionally, the domain classifier within the reconstructive domain adaptation module further improves the model’s stability and generalization across different network environments and time periods.

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extensively used in event monitoring and tracking, particularly in scenarios that require minimal human intervention. However, a key challenge in WSNs is the short lifespan of sensor nodes (SN), as continuous sensing leads to rapid battery depletion. In high-traffic areas, sensors located near the sink node exhaust their energy quickly, creating an energy-hole issue. As a result, optimizing energy usage is a significant challenge for WSN-assisted applications. To address this, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Routing and Cluster Head Selection in Wireless Sensor Network through an Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network for Golden Search Optimization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Network (EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA). This method involves selecting the Cluster Head (CH) using Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network (ADRGAN), minimizing energy consumption, and reducing a number of dead sensor nodes. Subsequently, Golden Search Optimization Algorithm (GSOA) is employed to determine an optimal path for data transmission to the sink node, maximizing energy efficiency, and elongating sensor node lifespan. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA method is simulated in MATLAB. The performance metrics, such as network lifetime, number of alive nodes, number of dead nodes, throughput, energy consumption, and packet delivery ratio is examined.

    "abstract": "In recent years, intelligent transportation systems have played a pivotal role in the development of smart cities, with vehicle retrieval becoming a critical component of traffic management and surveillance. Traditional vehicle retrieval systems rely heavily on image-based matching techniques derived from vehicle re-identification (VReID) tasks. However, these approaches are limited by their dependency on image queries, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios. Natural language (NL)-based vehicle retrieval systems offer a more flexible and accessible alternative by enabling users to query vehicles using textual descriptions. Despite progress in NL-based retrieval, existing methods face challenges in fully capturing multi-granularity information and aligning heterogeneous visual and linguistic inputs. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a robust Multimodal Vehicle Retrieval (MVR) model that integrates both visual and textual data through a dual-stream architecture. Our model captures complementary local features, alongside global information including motion and environmental context. We utilize InfoNCE and instance losses to align the visual and textual modalities within a shared feature space, while post-processing modules, including Granular Vehicle Feature Refinement and Spatial Relationship Modeling, further enhance retrieval performance by refining vehicle attributes and contextual relationships. Our experiments, conducted on the CityFlow-NL dataset, demonstrate that our model achieves a 35.6% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), a 41.3% increase in recall at 5 (R@5), and a 22.9% improvement in recall at 10 (R@10) compared to the baseline, and overcomes the inherent challenges of cross-modal retrieval in improving real-world VReID.",

The extensive experiments indicate that the proposed approach achieves improved performance both in human perception and quantitative analysis compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",
    "introduction": "In the environmental security monitoring of smart cities, the infrared and visible image fusion method deployed on intelligent systems based on cloud and fog computing plays a vital role in providing enhanced images for target detection systems. However, the fusion quality can be significantly influenced by the illumination of the monitoring scenario in visible images. Therefore, conventional methods typically suffer a severe performance drop under the condition of insufficient illumination.",

    "abstract": "Customer satisfaction is not just a significant factor but a cornerstone for smart cities and their organizations that offer services to people. It enhances the organization’s reputation and profitability and drastically raises the chances of returning customers. Unfortunately, customer support service through online chat is often not rated by customers to help improve the service. This study employs artificial intelligence and data augmentation to predict customer satisfaction ratings from conversations by analyzing the responses of customers and service providers. For the study, the authors obtained actual conversations between customers and real agents from the call center database of Jeddah Municipality that were rated by customers on a scale of 1–5. They trained and tested five prediction models with approaches based on logistic regression, random forest, and ensemble-based deep learning, and fine-tuned two pre-trained recent models: ArabicT5 and SaudiBERT. Then, they repeated training and testing models after applying a data augmentation technique using the generative artificial intelligence, GPT-4, to improve the unbalance in customer conversation data. The study found that the ensemble-based deep learning approach best predicts the five-, three-, and two-class classifications. Moreover, data augmentation improved accuracy using the ensemble-based deep learning model with a 1.69% increase and the logistic regression model with a 3.84% increase. This study contributes to the advancement of Arabic opinion mining, as it is the first to report the performance of determining customer satisfaction levels using Arabic conversation data.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is employed to improve the model's feature selection process and choose the most pertinent features for traffic prediction, producing forecasts that are more effective and precise. Utilizing real-time data, the performance of the suggested strategy was assessed, enabling it to adjust to shifting traffic patterns and deliver precise projections for intelligent transportation management.

It has valuable applications in numerous areas of future sustainable and smart cities including robotics, intelligent systems, security, and transportation. However, current IR-based recognition approaches predominantly concentrate on spatial or local temporal information and often overlook the potential value of global temporal patterns. This oversight can lead to incomplete representations of body part movements and prevent accurate optimization of a network. Therefore, a contextual-motion coalescence network (CMCNet) is proposed that operates in a streamlined and end-to-end manner for robust action representation in darkness in a near-infrared (NIR) setting. Initially, data are preprocessed to separate foreground, normalized, and resized. The framework employs two parallel modules: the contextual visual features learning module (CVFLM) for local feature extraction, and the temporal optical flow learning module (TOFLM) for acquiring motion dynamics. These modules focus on action-relevant regions used shift window-based operations to ensure accurate interpretation of motion information. The coalescence block harmoniously integrates the contextual and motion features within a unified framework. Finally, the temporal decoder module discriminatively identifies the boundaries of the action sequence. This sequence of steps ensures the synergistic optimization of both CVFLM and TOFLM and thorough competent feature extraction for precise AR.

Direct inspections and manual annotations are costly at scale, while conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. This study explores vision language models as a tool for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation. Although these models excel at describing common objects in human-centric images, their training sets may lack signals for esoteric built environment features, making their performance uncertain. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a vision language model and a visual prompting strategy that considers segmented image elements.

    "contribution": "This study explores vision language models as a tool for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation. Although these models excel at describing common objects in human-centric images, their training sets may lack signals for esoteric built environment features, making their performance uncertain. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a vision language model and a visual prompting strategy that considers segmented image elements.

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting Origin-Destination (OD) flows is crucial for urban planning and transportation management. Traditional OD prediction models, while effective within single cities, often face limitations when applied across different cities due to varied traffic conditions, urban layouts, and socio-economic factors. In this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs.

However, most existing analysis methods are single-task driven and ignore the spatio-temporal information of gas sensing data. To address these problems, we propose a Transformer-based cyber-physical social security system (CPSS) for UGC analysis. Specifically, this unified system integrates multiple tasks, i.e. quality assessment and control of gas data, security factors of user consumption, and spatio-temporal abnormal gas signal detection. In the developed Transformer-based model, a time-space cross-attention module is embedded for combining the long-range spatio-temporal dependences of gas data. Moreover, a feature memory block module is introduced for abnormal feature enhancement and high-level representation of gas quality.

Hence, an efficient, novel, robust, and lightweight YOLOv8-based weapon detector with GhostNet backbone and C3 module with transformer block (C3TR) neck (YOLO-GTWDNet model) is proposed for detecting the weapons either from stored images or from the live video streams. The proposed model is trained using a weapon dataset named “Weapon7,” which is developed by collecting various weapon classes, such as Axe, Bow and arrow, Gun, Knife, Lathi, Pistol, and Sword, from various publicly available datasets, Internet, and own camera capture. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed YOLO-GTWDNet model. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models when compared using both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. The deployment of the proposed model is expected to bolster public safety significantly, providing city authorities with a powerful tool to mitigate risks and swiftly address potential threats.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the fine-grained urban flows based on the coarse-grained flow observations is practically important to many smart city-related applications. Adequate data is usually a prerequisite for existing machine learning methods, especially most deep learning models. However, many cities still suffer from the data scarcity issue due to the unbalanced city development levels. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel cross-city fine-grained urban flow inference model named FGITrans, which aims to effectively transfer the knowledge from the data-rich cities to the data-scarce cities. Specifically, we design a weight-sharing triple-branch transformer framework which adopts self-attention and cross-attention for source/target city feature learning and domain alignment, respectively. Then, we propose a novel spatio-temporal adaptive embedding (STAE) layer for our transformer framework, and introduce a cross-city knowledge distillation (CKD) loss to narrow the cross-city disparities. The CKD loss explicitly enforces the framework to learn the discriminative domain-specific and domain-invariant representations simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on four large real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of FGITrans compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

Existing approaches mostly rely on a large number of high quality urban flow data, but neglect the data sparsity issue which is common in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the performance of existing methods may not be promising towards cities that lack sufficient traffic flow data. How to design a more generalizable urban flow inference model that is able to effectively transfer knowledge across multiple cities is challenging and remains as an open research problem. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained urban flow inference model named AdaTM, which leverages the city-specific and city-invariant knowledge extracted from multiple cities.

    "abstract": "Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SAMPLENET, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SAMPLENET. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SAMPLENET. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.",

    "introduction": "Cybercriminals have become an imperative threat because they target the most valuable resource on earth, data. Organizations prepare against cyber attacks by creating Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) that use various technologies to monitor and detect threats and to help perform forensics on machines and networks. Testing the limits of defense technologies and the skill of a CSIRT can be performed through adversary emulation performed by so-called “red teams”. The red team’s work is primarily manual and requires high skill.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of India's smart cities, precise meter readings are essential for effectively managing domestic energy and water systems. Nevertheless, meter reading employing conventional techniques prove to be both costly and time-consuming, especially considering the vast user base and deficit of everyday consumption analysis. To cope with this challenge, the proposed solution introduces a novel unified wireless smart metering system for measuring energy and water usage. This prototype harnesses the smart, advanced metering technology to manage energy and water resources. The presence of data and remote control capabilities in smart distribution transformers offers distribution operators the chance to optimize system operation and control. The innovative system proposed utilizes smart metering technology and incorporates a distribution system self-healing mechanism against power outages, revolutionizing the way utilities manage water and energy consumption. The system not only offers real-time consumption statistics to the utility provider but also provides the flexibility to remotely control the system's turn-on and turn-off functions. The system effectively captures real-time data, transmits it via LoRa to Telegram application. The system automatically re-establishes remote connections in the event of disconnections caused by emergency conditions or non-payment of the bill, once the relevant issue has been resolved. Additionally, the system promptly notifies authorities on overload, over-temperature, and instances of electricity theft. The system proficiently generates bills based on the consumed data and seamlessly transmits the consumed units to the authorities. The innovative system proposed has proven its ability to communicate effectively, yielding results that align with the given circumstances.",

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model.

Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise.

Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates.

    "abstract": "Accurate power load forecasting is critical to achieving the sustainability of energy management systems. However, conventional prediction methods suffer from low precision and stability because of crude modules for predicting short-term and medium-term loads. To solve such a problem, a Combined Modeling Power Load-Forecasting (CMPLF) method is proposed in this work. The CMPLF comprises two modules to deal with short-term and medium-term load forecasting, respectively.

    "abstract": "As cities transform, disrupting citizens' lives, their participation in urban development is often undervalued despite its importance. Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes. The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources.

In the third part, the discriminator attempts to differentiate the pre-fused image and VIS image, in order to learn details from VIS image based on the adversarial mechanism. Experimental results verify that the SaReGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Taipei City has been experimenting with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to enhance its smart capabilities, aiming to increase citizen satisfaction. This initiative is part of the city’s Smart City Proof of Concept (PoC) projects, which have been progressively rolled out since 2015. Most of these projects incorporate AI tools or algorithms, such as the combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) with AI to form AIoT, or the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). The objective is to leverage the latest technological developments to achieve a smarter Taipei. This study analyzes the execution of 302 PoC projects, categorizing them into 22 technological segments that together form an AI framework for smart city construction applications. This framework corresponds to 15 major issues of concern to Taipei’s residents, with the potential to address or mitigate 13 of them. According to the IMD Smart City Index Report 2023, Taipei’s smart city rating improved from a B in 2021 to an A in 2023, indicating progress. The results demonstrate that the AI framework derived from dissecting multiple PoC projects can effectively enhance the city’s smart construction ratings. This framework, aligned with major municipal concerns, proposes solutions driven by AI, guiding Taipei’s digital transformation into a smarter city and enabling its citizens to enjoy an improved quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Predictive analytics technologies like machine learning, AI and Generative AI models like Large Language Models (LLMs), have garnered enthusiasm for their potential to improve healthcare services in smart cities. However, these rapidly developing intelligent agents that guides the healthcare decisions may also risk exacerbating health inequities along racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic lines, reflecting systemic discrimination ingrained within healthcare practices. Flawed or injudiciously applied AI systems could improperly restrict opportunities and provide substandard care for minority groups by propagating historical patterns of prejudice encoded within limited training datasets. These advanced intelligent technologies can hinder the sustainable health solutions for smart cities. This study examines intelligent AI models and applications in healthcare settings, with a focus on assessing impacts on marginalized and disadvantaged populations. Comprehensive scholarly database searches identified 45 relevant studies investigating issues on algorithmic bias, lack of diverse training data, and discrimination risks linked to healthcare AI systems. The review finds most applications still lack adequate safeguards to prevent discrimination against vulnerable populations. Through the review of these systems, we propose an integrated inclusive smart health model that considers both technical interventions as well as broader participatory and ethical approaches. Realizing AI’s fullest potential to meaningfully advance health justice requires not only algorithmic adjustments to mitigate bias, and efforts to improve diversity of training data, transparent analysis frameworks, and best practices for ensuring just AI systems in healthcare, but also a human-centered commitment to thoughtful, inclusive development approaches that center the needs and priorities of communities impacted by health disparities from the outset.",

    "abstract": "Building extraction is one of the important research directions that has attracted great attention in the field of remote sensing image processing. It refers to the process of accurately extracting building information such as the location and shape of buildings by analyzing and processing remote sensing images. This technology plays an irreplaceable and important role in urban planning, disaster management, map production, smart city construction, and other fields. In recent years, with the advancement of science and technology, especially the continuous evolution of earth observation technology and the rapid development of deep learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become an emerging solution for extracting buildings from remote sensing images because of their powerful feature extraction capability. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview and analysis of building extraction methods based on convolutional neural networks. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to summarize the building extraction methods from perspectives of model structure, multi-scale feature differences, lack of boundary information, and model complexity. This will help researchers to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and the applicable scenarios. In addition, several typical building datasets in this field are described in detail, as well as the potential issues associated with these datasets. Subsequently, by collecting experimental results of relevant algorithms on these typical datasets, a detailed discussion on the accuracy and parameter quantities of various methods is conducted, aiming to provide a comprehensive assessment of performance and applicability of these methods. Finally, based on the current research status of this field and looking forward to the new era of high-quality development in artificial intelligence, the future directions for building extraction are prospected. Specifically, this paper discusses the combination of Transformers and CNNs, the combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning, multi-modal data fusion, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods, real-time extraction based on large-scale remote sensing model, building instance segmentation, and building contour vector extraction. In conclusion, our review can provide some valuable references and inspirations for future related research, so as to promote the practical application and innovation of building extraction from remote sensing images. This will fulfill the demand for efficient and precise map information in remote sensing technology and other related fields, contributing to the sustainable and high-quality development of human society.",

Currently, although videos can be generated through the connection between 3D point clouds and large language models, there is currently no prompt project that directly interacts with one-dimensional through attribute calculation results.

Language-conditioned robot behavior plays a vital role in executing complex tasks by associating human commands or instructions with perception and actions. However, most language-conditioned policy-related research is limited to specific datasets and cannot generalize across different environments. In this study, we propose a novel imitation learning framework tailored for language-conditioned robotic tasks. Our framework includes specialized encoders designed for various benchmarks and utilizes two distinct models: the Transformer and Diffusion models. We rigorously evaluate this framework in three different robotic environments. Our findings indicate that the framework consistently delivers superior performance across multiple domains. Notably, we observe that the Transformer model is particularly effective in managing tasks with long trajectories, whereas the Diffusion model demonstrates enhanced proficiency in generating trajectories from limited training datasets.

The location big data obtained from human activities, which is cohesive with urban functions, provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, as urban functions become highly mixed, existing feature representation structures struggle to explicitly depict the latent human activity features, limiting their applicability for detecting mixed urban functions in a supervised manner. To close the gap, this study analogizes the latent human activity features to the shape, texture, and color semantics of images, with a contrastive learning framework being introduced to extract image-based crowd mobility features for detecting mixed urban functions. Firstly, by translating human activity features into image semantics, a novel feature representation structure termed the Trajectory Temporal Image (TTI) is proposed to explicitly represent human activity features. Secondly, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model is employed to extract image-based semantics in a self-supervised manner. Lastly, based on urban dynamics, a mathematical model is developed to represent mixed urban functions, and the decomposition of mixed urban functions is achieved using the theory of fuzzy sets. A case study is conducted using taxi trajectory data in three cities in China.

However, research that holistically considers diverse stakeholders in smart cities is scarce. This study utilizes data from four types of collaborators (academia, public sector, industry, and civil society actors) to identify key topics and suggest research areas for developing smart cities. We used latent Dirichlet allocation and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for topic extraction and analysis. The analysis reveals that sustainability and digital platform have received similar levels of interest from academia, industry, and government, whereas governance, resource, and green space are less frequently mentioned than technology-related topics. Hype cycle analysis, which considers public and media expectations, reveals that smart cities experienced rapid growth from 2015 to 2021, but the growth rate has slowed since 2022. This means that a breakthrough improvement in the current situation is required. Accordingly, we propose resolving the unbalanced distribution of topic interests among collaborators, especially in the areas of governance, environment, economy, and healthcare.

    "contribution": "This study utilizes data from four types of collaborators (academia, public sector, industry, and civil society actors) to identify key topics and suggest research areas for developing smart cities. We used latent Dirichlet allocation and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for topic extraction and analysis. The analysis reveals that sustainability and digital platform have received similar levels of interest from academia, industry, and government, whereas governance, resource, and green space are less frequently mentioned than technology-related topics. Hype cycle analysis, which considers public and media expectations, reveals that smart cities experienced rapid growth from 2015 to 2021, but the growth rate has slowed since 2022. This means that a breakthrough improvement in the current situation is required. Accordingly, we propose resolving the unbalanced distribution of topic interests among collaborators, especially in the areas of governance, environment, economy, and healthcare. We expect that our findings will help researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders in understanding which topics are underdeveloped in their fields and taking active measures for the future development of smart cities.",

Multimodal data, which can comprehensively perceive and recognize the physical world, has become an essential path towards general artificial intelligence. However, multimodal large models trained on public datasets often underperform in specific industrial domains. In this paper, we tackle the problem of building large vision-language intelligent models for specific industrial domains by leveraging the general large models and federated learning. We compare the challenges faced by federated learning in the era of small models and large models from different dimensions, and propose a technical framework for federated learning in the era of large models.Specifically, our framework mainly considers three aspects: heterogeneous model fusion, flexible aggregation methods, and data quality improvement. Based on this framework, we conduct a case study of leading enterprises contributing vision-language data and expert knowledge to city safety operation management. The preliminary experiments show that enterprises can enhance and accumulate their intelligence capabilities through federated learning, and jointly create an intelligent city model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy infrastructure security, residential community security and urban operation management.",

To deal with the frequent occlusions caused by multiple people, we design an occlusion encoder to detect and suppress severely occluded person crops. To explore the potential spatio-temporal relationship, we propose spatio-temporal transformers to simultaneously extract trajectory information and fuse inter-person features in a hierarchical manner.

Forest fires have become a noteworthy problem recently as a result of both natural and man-made climatic changes. A smart city application that uses a forest fire discovery technology based on artificial intelligence is provided in order to prevent significant catastrophes. A major danger to the environment, animals, and human lives is posed by forest fires. The early detection and suppression of these fires is crucial. This work offers a thorough method for detecting forest fires using advanced deep learning (DL) algorithms. Preprocessing the forest fire dataset is the initial step in order to improve its relevance and quality. Then, to enable the model to capture the dynamic character of forest fire data, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used to extract useful feature from the dataset. In this work, weight optimisation in LSTM is performed using a Modified Firefly Algorithm (MFFA), which enhances the model's performance and convergence. The Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Networks (VAEGAN) model is used to classify the retrieved features. Furthermore, every DL model's success depends heavily on hyperparameter optimisation. The hyperparameters of an VAEGAN model are tuned in this research using the Waterwheel Plant Optimisation Algorithm (WWPA), an optimisation technique inspired by nature. WPPA uses the idea of plant growth to properly tune the VAEGAN's parameters, assuring the network's peak fire detection performance.

It is necessary to establish sophisticated and robust attack detection techniques to defend against security threats as the use of drones becomes increasingly widespread and their applications diversify.

    "abstract": "Given the pervasive use of deep learning models across various domains, ensuring model security has emerged as a critical concern. This paper examines backdoor attacks, a form of security threat that compromises model output by poisoning the training data. Our investigation specifically addresses backdoor attacks on object detection models, vital for security-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and smart city systems. Consequently, such attacks on object detection models could pose significant risks to human life and property. Consequently, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose serious threats to human life and property. To elucidate this security risk, we propose and experimentally evaluate five backdoor attack methods for object detection models. The key findings are: (1) Unnecessary Object Generation: a globally embedded trigger creating false objects in the target class; (2) Partial Misclassification: a trigger causing specific class misclassification; (3) Global Misclassification: a trigger reclassifying all objects into the target class; (4) Specific Object Vanishing: a trigger causing non-detection of certain objects; (5) Object Position Shifting: a trigger causing bounding box shifts for a specific class. To assess attack effectiveness, we introduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR), which can surpass 1 in object detection tasks, thus providing a more accurate reflection of the attack impact. Experimental outcomes indicate that the ASR values of these varied backdoor attacks frequently approach or surpass 1, demonstrating our method's capacity to impact multiple objects simultaneously. Additionally, to augment trigger stealth, we introduce Backdoor Attack with Wavelet Embedding (BAWE), which discreetly embeds triggers as image watermarks in training data. This embedding method yields more natural triggers with enhanced stealth. Highly stealthy triggers are less detectable, significantly increasing the likelihood of attack success and efficacy. We have developed a Transformer-based network architecture, diverging from traditional neural network frameworks. Our experiments across various object detection datasets highlight the susceptibility of these models and the high success rate of our approaches. This vulnerability poses significant risks to digital twin systems utilizing object detection technology. Our methodology not only enhances trigger stealth but also suits dense predictive tasks and circumvents current neural network backdoor attack detection methods. The experimental findings expose key challenges in the security of object detection models, particularly when integrated with digital twins, offering new avenues for backdoor attack research and foundational insights for devising defense strategies against these attacks.",

However, traditional MCS often suffers from performance degradation due to the limited spatiotemporal coverage of collected data. In this context, Sparse MCS has been proposed, which utilizes data inference algorithms to recover full data from sparse data collected by users. However, existing Sparse MCS approaches often overlook spatiotemporal fractures, where no data is observed either for a sensing subarea across all sensing time slots (temporal fracture), or for a sensing time slot in all sensing subarea (spatial fracture). Such spatiotemporal fractures pose great challenges to the data inference algorithms, as it is difficult to capture the complex spatiotemporal correlations of the sensing data from very limited observations. To address this issue, we propose a Graph- and Attention-based Matrix Completion (GAMC) method for the spatiotemporal fracture data inference problem in Sparse MCS.

As a crucial supporting infrastructure, IoT devices are utilized in various fields to construct IoT networks. However, due to the inherent limitations of IoT devices, such as limited computing resources and low memory capacity, security concerns have become increasingly prominent. Among these concerns are Denial-of-Service (DoS) and botnet attacks, which are difficult to prevent due to their large-scale and covert nature. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid DoS Attack Intrusion Detection System (HDA-IDS) that combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to effectively identify both known and unknown DoS/botnet attacks. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel anomaly-based detection model called CL-GAN. It integrates CNN-LSTM with GAN to establish a baseline for normal behavior and detect malicious traffic. In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works.

However, hand-drawn sketches can be an inefficient means for matching facial photographs of the culprit, particularly in cases where the software is designed around using images of real faces. In this research work, a novel technique is proposed to generate hyperreal high-definition (H-HD) face images of the culprit from a single hand-drawn face sketch. ’Hyperreal’ is used here in the way it is used in the Arts, as in making the image, albeit based on a person’s thoughts, truer to reality through a deep understanding of how the real subject would appear.

In the presence of closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) in smart cities, there is an emerging challenge in apprehending criminals, leading to a need for innovative solutions. In this paper, the propose a model aimed at enhancing real-time emergency response capabilities and swiftly identifying criminals. This initiative aims to foster a safer environment and better manage criminal activity within smart cities. The proposed architecture combines an image-to-image stable diffusion model with violence detection and pose estimation approaches. The diffusion model generates synthetic data while the object detection approach uses YOLO v7 to identify violent objects like baseball bats, knives, and pistols, complemented by MediaPipe for action detection. Further, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network classifies the action attacks involving violent objects. Subsequently, an ensemble consisting of an edge device and the entire proposed model is deployed onto the edge device for real-time data testing using a dash camera. Thus, this study can handle violent attacks and send alerts in emergencies. As a result, our proposed YOLO model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 89.5% for violent attack detection, and the LSTM classifier model achieves an accuracy of 88.33% for violent action classification. The results highlight the model’s enhanced capability to accurately detect violent objects, particularly in effectively identifying violence through the implemented artificial intelligence system.",

    "contribution": "In this paper, the propose a model aimed at enhancing real-time emergency response capabilities and swiftly identifying criminals. This initiative aims to foster a safer environment and better manage criminal activity within smart cities. The proposed architecture combines an image-to-image stable diffusion model with violence detection and pose estimation approaches. The diffusion model generates synthetic data while the object detection approach uses YOLO v7 to identify violent objects like baseball bats, knives, and pistols, complemented by MediaPipe for action detection. Further, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network classifies the action attacks involving violent objects. Subsequently, an ensemble consisting of an edge device and the entire proposed model is deployed onto the edge device for real-time data testing using a dash camera. Thus, this study can handle violent attacks and send alerts in emergencies. As a result, our proposed YOLO model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 89.5% for violent attack detection, and the LSTM classifier model achieves an accuracy of 88.33% for violent action classification. The results highlight the model’s enhanced capability to accurately detect violent objects, particularly in effectively identifying violence through the implemented artificial intelligence system.",

    "abstract": "In Internet of Things-based smart grids, smart meters record and report a massive number of power consumption data at certain intervals to the data center of the utility for load monitoring and energy management. Energy theft is a big problem for smart meters and causes non-technical losses. Energy theft attacks can be launched by malicious consumers by compromising the smart meters to report manipulated consumption data for less billing. It is a global issue causing technical and financial damage to governments and operators. Deep learning-based techniques can effectively identify consumers involved in energy theft through power consumption data. In this study, a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-based energy-theft-detection system is proposed to detect data-tampering cyber-attack vectors. CNN is a commonly employed method that automates the extraction of features and the classification process. We employed CNN for feature extraction and traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. In this work, honest data were obtained from a real dataset. Six attack vectors causing data tampering were utilized. Tampered data were synthetically generated through these attack vectors. Six separate datasets were created for each attack vector to design a specialized detector tailored for that specific attack. Additionally, a dataset containing all attack vectors was also generated for the purpose of designing a general detector. Furthermore, the imbalanced dataset problem was addressed through the application of the generative adversarial network (GAN) method. GAN was chosen due to its ability to generate new data closely resembling real data, and its application in this field has not been extensively explored. The data generated with GAN ensured better training for the hybrid CNN-based detector on honest and malicious consumption patterns. Finally, the results indicate that the proposed general detector could classify both honest and malicious users with satisfactory accuracy.",

It is challenging because agent interactions and underlying continuous dynamics jointly affect its behavior. Existing approaches often rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Transformers to extract agent interaction features. However, they tend to neglect how the distance and velocity information between agents impact their interactions dynamically. Moreover, previous methods use RNNs or first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics, which may lack interpretability with respect to how each agent is driven by interactions.

Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder architecture, incorporating spatial-temporal Transformers with distance information and dynamic interaction graph construction in the encoder module.

The images captured by drones usually have huge scale changes due to the flying and shooting at different altitudes, which puts a burden on traditional deep learning networks. The Transformer-based network has proven successful in computer vision tasks due to its strong long sequence memory analysis capabilities. This article will design a network for object detection and analysis of drone images based on the Transformer structure. The main challenge with using transformers is the high computational cost of processing image sequences, so the common method is to use local attention instead of global attention and a hierarchical structure to compensate for the loss of global vision. However, the large amount of information lost caused by using local attention can not be made up for with this action simply. This paper analyzes the ideas of multiscale and hierarchical structure concepts and attention mechanisms, and embeds multiscale concepts into the local attention structure to further make up for the global view information lost. In order to achieve this, we used the pooling concept to build multiscale pooling layers combined with a pyramid structure and applied it to the multi-head self-attention module. At the same time, we precut the image features entering the pooling block to reduce the length of the image token sequence. While reducing the calculation amount of the vision transformer, the global visual field information is increased as much as possible to obtain better contextual features. On VisDrone dataset, MRPVT as a backbone achieves 47.98% AP50 and 25.20% AP75 accuracy and on UAVDT's car category achieves 98.84% AP50 and 89.27% AP75 accuracy.

Descriptive statistics are employed to identify patterns in parking occupancy and violation frequencies, while Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms enhance predictive and generative analytics for forecasting parking needs and simulating scenarios with other mobility aspects. Advanced analytics uncover hidden patterns and behaviors, and visualization tools map data onto the urban layout to facilitate spatial planning and resource allocation. Scenario simulation enables urban planners to assess the impact of different strategies in a virtual environment prior to real-world implementation. The integration of Generative Artificial Intel- ligence (GenAl) models further enhances predictive capabilities and scenario generation. Preliminary results demonstrate the DT platform's potential in improving urban mobility management, particularly in optimizing parking meter placement and enhancing user experience. Although limited data availability affects long-term prediction accuracy, the model exhibits robustness and adaptability for extended forecasting horizons.",

    "abstract": "Human mobility prediction is fundamental to designing intelligent cities and forecasting how people move during disasters and health emergencies, specifically in emergency responses. However, the existing method for human mobility prediction is mainly designed for normal scenarios and is incapable of handling the case of a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges over the past few years: the powerful pandemic has a fundamental and long-lasting influence on mobility, which is hard to model. Inspired by recent progress in the Large Language Model, we present the Human Mobility Prediction-Large Language Model (HMP-LLM), which utilizes LLMs with understanding and reasoning abilities to do human mobility prediction tasks. Especially to adapt LLMs to intervened time series prediction, we propose the following critical designs: 1) Seasonal Decompose. 2) Two-stage Prompts Designing. We convert the input data into textual prototypes so LLMs can understand it, then we use two-stage prompts to guide the language model in reasoning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm the superiority of HMP-LLM over existing methods. Besides, due to the zero-shot nature and the expansibility of our two-stage design, HMP-LLM is expected to be used in other public safety incidents.",

This progression empowers researchers to access more valuable data and information from remote sensing images. Concepts, such as remote sensing big data, remote sensing foundation models, and smart cities, have successively emerged in recent years, imposing increased demands on the intelligent extraction technology of massive remote sensing data, particularly regarding remote sensing image information. As an indispensable element of intelligent information extraction technology applied in fields, such as land use and cover, national land resource surveys, natural disaster observation, agricultural yield estimation, and forestry protection, remote sensing image classification exhibits substantial practical importance. Remote sensing image scene classification has been introduced in this context. The objective of scene classification in remote sensing images is to comprehensively and semantically categorize each given remote sensing image. This task entails summarizing and analyzing the extracted feature information at a high level and assigning different labels to areas of interest based on their features. In contrast with natural images, although they contain features, such as color, texture, and shape, remote sensing images encounter more challenges in classification due to the intricate scene content resulting from the overhead perspective, weak texture, and color information caused by low resolution. Nevertheless, as one of the technical means in remote sensing applications, remote sensing image scene classification technology plays a pivotal role in the development of practical application technologies. After years of development, numerous comprehensive review studies on remote sensing image scene classification have been conducted locally and abroad. However, the recent surge in remote sensing big data has introduced new challenges into scene classification. The ongoing evolution of deep learning technology, particularly the widespread application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, has resulted in significant advancements in remote sensing image scene classification. In this context, self-supervised learning, as a method that is independent of annotated data, has become indispensable in the field of remote sensing image scene classification. Foundation models based on self-supervised learning have been successfully implemented in scene classification, presenting innovative solutions to this field. As the volume of remote sensing data continues to increase, the dataset scale for remote sensing image scene classification is expanding rapidly, giving rise to increasingly intricate classification tasks.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of intelligent industry and smart city increases the number of surveillance devices, greatly enhancing the need for unsupervised automatic anomaly detection in real-Time video surveillance, which uses raw data without laborious manual annotations. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods encounter limitations when utilizing pretext tasks, such as reconstruction or prediction to identify abnormal events, as these tasks are not completely consistent and complementary with the essential objective of anomaly detection. Motivated by recent advances in diffusion models, we propose a multiscale recovery diffusion model, which relies on the proposed novel and effective pretext task named recovery to introduce the notion of generation speed. It utilizes critical step-by-step generation of diffusion probabilistic models in unsupervised anomaly detection scenarios. By incorporating a proposed multiscale spatial-Temporal subtraction module, our model captures more detailed appearance and motion information of foreground objects without relying on other high-level pretrained models. Furthermore, an innovative push-pull loss further extends the disparity between normal and abnormal events through pseudolabels. We validate our model on five established benchmarks: UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and UCF-Crime, achieving frame-level area under the curves of 86.01%, 99.23%, 92.35%, 82.49%, and 74.79%, respectively, surpassing other state-of-The-Art unsupervised VAD methods.",

We validate our model on five established benchmarks: UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and UCF-Crime, achieving frame-level area under the curves of 86.01%, 99.23%, 92.35%, 82.49%, and 74.79%, respectively, surpassing other state-of-The-Art unsupervised VAD methods.",
    "introduction": "The rapid development of intelligent industry and smart city increases the number of surveillance devices, greatly enhancing the need for unsupervised automatic anomaly detection in real-Time video surveillance, which uses raw data without laborious manual annotations. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods encounter limitations when utilizing pretext tasks, such as reconstruction or prediction to identify abnormal events, as these tasks are not completely consistent and complementary with the essential objective of anomaly detection.",

Traditional methods, such as face-based and fingerprint-based authentication, usually incur high costs to be installed in all this kind of environments. In this paper, we develop a ubiquitous low-effort user authentication approach, mmPalm, based on palm recognition using millimeter wave (mmWave) signals. mmWave technology has been adopted by WiGig and 5G, making mmPalm a low-cost solution that can be widely adopted in public places. In addition, the high resolution of mmWave signals allows mmPalm to extract detailed palm characteristics (e.g., palm geometry, skin thickness, and texture) that can assemble distinctive palmprints for user authentication. Our innovative virtual antennas design further increases the spatial resolution of a commercial mmWave device, enabling it to fully capture the comprehensive palmprint features. Moreover, to address the challenge of small-scale environmental changes (e.g., variations in palm-device distances and palm orientations), we design a novel palm profile augmentation method, utilizing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic palm profiles for mitigating palm instability. Furthermore, we design a cross-environment adaptation framework based on transfer learning to address the challenge of large-scale environmental changes, including multipath variations introduced by human bodies and nearby furniture. Extensive experiments with 30 participants through 6 months demonstrate that mmPalm achieves 99% authentication accuracy with resilience against different types of attacks, including random, impersonation, and counterfeit.",

However, challenges arise, particularly in scenarios with occlusions and adverse weather conditions, where traditional methods may fall short in ensuring safety. To address these challenges, a novel track-by-detection approach is introduced aimed at enhancing transportation systems. The approach integrates key components, including the Detection Transformer (DETR) for emphasizing global context, and the You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) renowned for capturing local context. Additionally, the deep sort tracking filter is incorporated to enhance object tracking accuracy. A pivotal aspect of the approach lies in the utilization of the deep sort of filter for object tracking, preceded by preprocessing with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to refine tracking outcomes. This buffering approach significantly improves tracking quality by reducing noise and enhancing feature representation. Moreover, the approach leverages tracking from satellite videos, enabling comprehensive monitoring of transportation activities across vast regions. The refined tracking outputs, including those from satellite videos, are fused with direct outputs from the trackers obtained from both YOLOv7 and DETR. These integrated fused buffered tracked bounding boxes demonstrate superior performance compared to individual approaches. Validation using simulated imagery under cloudy conditions, incorporating the Motion Evaluation Metric (MOT), showcases enhanced accuracy across various transportation objects. Implementing this approach in ITS promise's benefits such as enhanced traffic management and increased efficiency in public transportation.

Existing methods for classifying building types often face challenges in accurately distinguishing buildings between types while maintaining well-delineated boundaries, especially in complex urban environments. This study introduces a novel framework, i.e., CNN-Transformer cross-attention feature fusion network (CTCFNet), for building type classification from very-high-resolution remote sensing images. CTCFNet integrates CNNs and Transformers using an interactive cross-encoder fusion (ICEF) module that enhances semantic feature learning and improves classification accuracy in complex scenarios. We develop an adaptive collaboration optimization (ACO) module that applies human visual attention mechanisms to enhance the feature representation of building types and boundaries simultaneously. To address the scarcity of datasets in building type classification, we create two new datasets: the urban building type (UBT) dataset and the town building type (TBT) dataset, for model evaluation. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that CTCFNet outperforms popular CNNs, Transformers, and dual-encoder methods in identifying building types across various regions, achieving the highest MIoU of 78.20% and 77.11%, F1 scores of 86.83% and 88.22%, and OA of 95.07% and 95.73% on the UBT and TBT datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Due to the growing level of transportation systems, numerous social troubles arise and create serious hazards like air pollution, the greenhouse effect, and traffic congestion. Hence, Traffic forecasting is essential for providing numerous applications in smart city management like congestion avoidance, navigation guidance, and urban traffic control. Still, the traffic prediction is difficult, since each road network is greatly dependent on other networks in a temporally and spatially manner. For capturing the temporal and spatial dependency, the Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX) - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Forward Taylor Network (NxLFTN)based traffic forecasting is proposed in this paper. The traffic network is considered as a graph, which contains the spatio-temporal data. The spatio-temporal data is high-dimensional and complex. To embed the data into a low-dimensionality region, the spatio-temporal embedding (STE) generator is employed. Moreover, the STE generator is used for predicting the daily embedding and the weekly embedding of the time related to the present traffic signal. At last, the traffic forecasting is carried out using the NxLFTNet. In addition, the Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Root Mean square error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to validate the effectiveness of the NxLFTNet.

    "contribution": "For capturing the temporal and spatial dependency, the Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX) - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Forward Taylor Network (NxLFTN)based traffic forecasting is proposed in this paper. The traffic network is considered as a graph, which contains the spatio-temporal data. The spatio-temporal data is high-dimensional and complex. To embed the data into a low-dimensionality region, the spatio-temporal embedding (STE) generator is employed. Moreover, the STE generator is used for predicting the daily embedding and the weekly embedding of the time related to the present traffic signal. At last, the traffic forecasting is carried out using the NxLFTNet. In addition, the Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Root Mean square error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to validate the effectiveness of the NxLFTNet. It offered the finest MAPE, RMSE, and MAE of 0.003, 0.046, and 0.04 when considering the data from the Contra Costa country in Greater Bay Area (GBA) of LargeST dataset for delay is 50 minutes.",
    "introduction": "Due to the growing level of transportation systems, numerous social troubles arise and create serious hazards like air pollution, the greenhouse effect, and traffic congestion. Hence, Traffic forecasting is essential for providing numerous applications in smart city management like congestion avoidance, navigation guidance, and urban traffic control. Still, the traffic prediction is difficult, since each road network is greatly dependent on other networks in a temporally and spatially manner.",

Existing firmware attestation techniques often require high computational budget or access to the device's authentic firmware, posing challenges due to resource and proprietary constraints. To counter these two fundamental challenges, this article introduces a novel software-based attestation framework utilizing RAM traces from IoT devices for remote verification. In the proposed framework, the need for an authentic firmware copy is eliminated, and the most computationally intensive task is assigned to the gateway node of the IoT ecosystem. This approach yields a robust and highly accurate device attestation strategy, while imposing minimal computational demands on the verification device itself. Employing deep learning models trained in a representation learning paradigm, our framework enables the remote verifier to authenticate the internal state of IoT devices. Leveraging data collected from real-world prototype devices, under eight different applications, our approach achieves a remarkable 100% accuracy in detecting critical attacks on IoT devices with a false positive rate of 10-3 Notably, our framework preserves device availability and maintains low authentication latency, underscoring its efficacy and practicality for securing IoT ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The 3D virtual terrain generation is currently used in geography teaching and setting up relevant virtual scenes according to the teaching content, which can visually display the verification experimental conditions and results and enhance the universality of virtual geography experiments. In the field of digital twin smart city, traffic, and water simulation, constructing virtual terrain according to the real terrain can provide the basic environment for subsequent development and experiments. In military simulation, it can quickly build beyond the real scenes of extreme training environment, which has a key role in improving military training and enhancing combat capabilities. Hand-drawn feature sketches can express 3D virtual terrain under human subjective perception. Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details. This model is applied to the real natural landscape display and terrain evolution, and it can meet the user’s needs to obtain the virtual terrain with high realistic feeling after inputting the hand-drawn terrain feature sketch. This improved model proposed in this paper has good prospects for 3D terrain modeling and editing.",

Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details. This model is applied to the real natural landscape display and terrain evolution, and it can meet the user’s needs to obtain the virtual terrain with high realistic feeling after inputting the hand-drawn terrain feature sketch.",

Our design is based on two pieces of prior knowledge in the traffic flow forecasting literature: (i) spatiotemporal dependencies can be factorized into spatial and temporal dependencies; (ii) adjacent regions have more influences than distant regions, and temporal characteristics of closeness, period and trend are more important than crossed relations between them. Our ProSTformer has two characteristics. First, each block in ProSTformer highlights the unique dependencies, ProSTformer progressively focuses on spatial dependencies from local to global regions, on temporal dependencies from closeness, period and trend to crossed relations between them, and on external dependencies such as weather conditions, temperature and day-of-week. Second, we use the Tensor Rearranging technique to force the model to compute self-attention only to adjacent regions and to the unique temporal characteristic. Then, we use the Patch Merging technique to greatly reduce self-attention computation times to distant regions and crossed temporal relations. We evaluate ProSTformer on two traffic datasets and find that it performs better than sixteen baseline models. The code is available at https://github.com/yanxiao1930/ProSTformer_code/tree/main.",

    "abstract": "Significance Optical fiber sensors play an increasingly important role in safety monitoring areas in the smart Internet of Things (IoT). Particularly, a fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensor (fiber-optic DAS) based on the phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Φ‑OTDR) technology provides a highly dense, cost-effective, and continuous environment measurement way over a wide range. All kinds of vibration sources can be sensed and located with high sensitivity and precision utilizing the widely laid ordinary telecommunication cables, and thus fiber-optic DAS has been applied in various ground listening applications, such as natural disaster prediction of ocean-floor seismic activity, volcanic events, and earthquake, energy exploration in oil and gas industry, and civil infrastructure monitoring in the pipelines, railways, and perimeters. It leads to a new generation of large-scale fiber-optic IoT for ground and underwater listening technology. From the current research status in China and abroad, DAS is becoming mature in its hardware performance, such as the demodulation fidelity, sensing distance, detection bandwidth, and sensitivity, which are all approaching their perfection. However, with the rapid advance of DAS applications, the complicated and ever-changing environments for large-scale monitoring have brought about challenges of high false alarm rates due to its advantages of high sensitivity. It is difficult to achieve high-precision detection, recognition, and positioning of perceived vibration and acoustic targets, which has become the biggest technical bottleneck restricting the large-scale application of DAS technology. In recent years, driven by the development of advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the signal processing methods of fully intelligent DAS with high accuracy and real-time performance in practical complex environments have become a research hotspot and focus in the field of fiber-optic sensing. The signal processing method in DAS plays a crucial and decisive role in improving the intelligent perception ability of the entire system. Progress We review the current research status of signal processing methods in smart fiber-optic DAS entering the deep learning stage, from mainstream supervised learning to unsupervised, semi-supervised, and transfer learning, from single-source detection to multi-source aliasing detection, and from single-task recognition or localization to simultaneous implementation of recognition and localization tasks, and we predict possible research directions for further improving the intelligent processing performance and perception ability of DAS in the future. Firstly, the typical fiber-optic DAS system structure and its vibration/sound sensing mechanism (Fig. 2), and the smart DAS and its signal processing architecture in smart city monitoring applications (Fig. 3) are introduced. Then, the signal processing methods based on deep learning are explained in detail, which includes the main stream of supervised learning methods based on multi-dimensional information extraction, and semi-supervised, unsupervised learning, and cross-scene transfer learning methods in DAS. For the supervised learning method, it includes DAS signal recognition models based on temporal information extraction, such as one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) (Fig. 4), multi-scale convolutional neural networks (MS-CNNs) (Fig. 5), multi-scale and contextual temporal relationship mining methods (Figs. 6-7), and the two-dimensional recognition models based on time-frequency (Figs. 8-11), time-space (Figs. 12-14), and space-frequency (Fig. 15) information extraction technologies. Besides, some other supervised methods are also included, for example, recognition models based on attention-based long short-term memory (Fig. 16) and the fusion of manual features and deep features. It proves that the combination of traditional empirical rules and deep learning networks can further reduce the false alarm rate of the system. In response to the problem of insufficient labeled samples in new scenarios in practical applications, several semi-supervised recognition methods based on the 1D-SSGAN (one-dimensional semi-supervised generative adversarial network), SSAE (sparse stacked autoencoder), and FixMatch models have been involved to achieve accurate recognition of DAS signals with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, the SNN-based DAS unsupervised learning network (Fig. 17) and the cross-scene transfer learning network based on AlexNet+SVM (Fig. 18) also appear to improve the generalization ability of DAS signal recognition methods. In order to evaluate the performance of these recognition models, we introduce seven indicators for evaluating the recognition accuracy and four indicators for the processing time of the algorithms. The above key DAS recognition methods and their performance are statistically compared in Table 2. At last, the new challenges of smart DAS sensing, from single-source detection to multi-source aliasing detection, from target recognition to localization, and from a single task to multi-task processing, as well as other methods to enhance its intelligent perception capabilities, have also been introduced. Conclusions and Prospects Further improvement of signal processing and its sensing capabilities still faces new challenges and opportunities and will open a new chapter in fully intelligent DAS. Stable, accurate, real-time, and efficient signal recognition in DAS in new complicated application scenarios remains a research hotspot in the field of distributed fiber-optic sensing in the future, including: 1) improving the generalization ability of DAS recognition models in cross scenarios; 2) significant improvement in real-time processing capabilities in DAS; 3) improvement of multi-task processing ability in DAS; 4) implementation of high-performance on-chip DAS.",

    "abstract": "Semantic image synthesis, a pivotal task in image-to-image translation, has been widely addressed using generative adversarial network (GAN) models. However, existing GAN-based approaches often suffer from inadequate incorporation of structural and spatial information, resulting in unsatisfactory quality of the synthesized images and a pronounced disparity between photo-realistic and generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based methodology to address these limitations, enabling the generation of high-resolution images from semantic label maps while bridging the quality gap and preserving detailed information in the generated outputs. The proposed approach leverages a two-step process, starting with a local binary pattern convolutional generator that produces a local binary pattern feature map. Subsequently, a global convolutional generator is fed with the segmentation map and the feature map through a learned modulation scheme facilitated by a multi-feature adaptive denormalization layer (MFADE) during the training process to generate photo-realistic images.

    "contribution": "In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based methodology to address these limitations, enabling the generation of high-resolution images from semantic label maps while bridging the quality gap and preserving detailed information in the generated outputs. The proposed approach leverages a two-step process, starting with a local binary pattern convolutional generator that produces a local binary pattern feature map. Subsequently, a global convolutional generator is fed with the segmentation map and the feature map through a learned modulation scheme facilitated by a multi-feature adaptive denormalization layer (MFADE) during the training process to generate photo-realistic images.

    "introduction": "Semantic image synthesis, a pivotal task in image-to-image translation, has been widely addressed using generative adversarial network (GAN) models. However, existing GAN-based approaches often suffer from inadequate incorporation of structural and spatial information, resulting in unsatisfactory quality of the synthesized images and a pronounced disparity between photo-realistic and generated images.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds provides foundational knowledge for various geodetic and cartographic applications, including autonomous driving, smart cities, and indoor navigation. However, point cloud data's unstructured and inherently disordered characteristics pose challenges in extracting accurate 3-D semantic information. In this study, we introduce a novel semantic segmentation network for large-scale point cloud scenes, referred to as dense dual-branch cross attention network (D2CAN). We propose a local multidimensional feature aggregation (LMFA) module to increase multidimensional feature representation types and preserve rich local details. Based on the augmented local features, an expanded dual-branch cross attention (EDCA) module establishes internal deep connections between multidimensional attributes and semantic features. This assists the network in reducing boundary ambiguities and expanding the receptive field, enabling the parallel capture of long-range contexts specifically adapted for large-scale scene point cloud segmentation. These two modules work collaboratively to constitute a local context deep perception (LCDP) block. To reduce information loss during feature sampling and propagation, we propose a global feature pyramid dense fusion (GFDF) block. This block adaptively integrates features across different scales and effectively captures global context with long-range dependencies. In conclusion, D2CAN combines LCDP and GFDF to aggregate both local and global contexts, resulting in robust feature discrimination for semantic segmentation of large-scale scenes. Our method's effectiveness and superior generation ability have been validated across three challenging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Toronto-3D, SensatUrban, and Stanford large-scale 3-D indoor spaces (S3DIS) datasets, with mean intersection over union (IoU) values of 83.5%, 61.1%, and 72.3%, respectively.",

Such problems not only exist in the traditional deep learning field, but also exist in criminal investigation, scientific photography and other fields, such as the accuracy of low-light image. However, in the current research results, there is no perfect means to deal with the above problems. Therefore, the study of low-light image enhancement has important theoretical significance and practical application value for the development of smart cities. In order to improve the quality of low-light enhanced images, this paper tries to introduce the luminance attention mechanism to improve the enhancement efficiency. The main contents of this paper are summarized as follows: using the attention mechanism, we proposed a method of low-light image enhancement based on the brightness attention mechanism and generative adversarial networks. This method uses brightness attention mechanism to predict the illumination distribution of low-light image and guides the enhancement network to enhance the image adaptiveness in different luminance regions. At the same time, u-NET network is designed and constructed to improve the modeling process of low-light image. We verified the performance of the algorithm on the synthetic data set and compared it with traditional image enhancement methods (HE, SRIE) and deep learning methods (DSLR).

In practice, the collected complaints form a massive dataset, making it difficult for government officers to analyze the big data effectively. It is consequently vital to use data mining algorithms to classify the citizen complaint data for efficient follow-up actions. However, different classification algorithms produce varied classification accuracies. Thus, this study aimed to compare the accuracy of several classification algorithms on crowdsourced citizen complaint data. Taking the case of the LAKSA app in Tangerang City, Indonesia, this study included k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost for the accuracy assessment. The data were taken from crowdsourced citizen complaints submitted to the LAKSA app, including those aggregated from official social media channels, from May 2021 to April 2022. The results showed SVM with a linear kernel as the most accurate among the assessed algorithms (89.2%). In contrast, AdaBoost (base learner: Decision Trees) produced the lowest accuracy. Still, the accuracy levels of all algorithms varied in parallel to the amount of training data available for the actual classification categories. Overall, the assessments on all algorithms indicated that their accuracies were insignificantly different, with an overall variation of 4.3%. The AdaBoost-based classification, in particular, showed its large dependence on the choice of base learners.

    "abstract": "In the context of smart city development, video surveillance serves as a critical component for maintaining public safety and operational efficiency. However, traditional surveillance systems are often constrained by a limited dynamic range, leading to the loss of essential image details. To address this limitation, this paper introduces HDRFormer, an innovative framework designed to enhance high dynamic range (HDR) image quality in edge–cloud-based video surveillance systems. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, HDRFormer employs a unique architecture comprising a feature extraction module (FEM) and a weighted attention module (WAM). The FEM leverages a transformer-based hierarchical structure to adeptly capture multi-scale image information. In addition, the guided filters are utilized to steer the network, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the images. On the other hand, the WAM focuses on reconstructing saturated areas, improving the perceptual quality of the images, and rendering the reconstructed HDR images with naturalness and color saturation. Extensive experiments on multiple HDR image reconstruction datasets demonstrate HDRFormer’s substantial improvements, achieving up to a 2.7 dB increase in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and an enhancement of 0.09 in the structural similarity (SSIM) compared to existing methods. In addition, the framework exhibits outstanding performance in multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and HDR visual difference predictor (HDR-VDP2.2). The proposed method not only outperforms the existing HDR reconstruction techniques but also offers better generalization capabilities, laying a robust foundation for future applications in smart cities.",

    "contribution": "To address this limitation, this paper introduces HDRFormer, an innovative framework designed to enhance high dynamic range (HDR) image quality in edge–cloud-based video surveillance systems. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, HDRFormer employs a unique architecture comprising a feature extraction module (FEM) and a weighted attention module (WAM). The FEM leverages a transformer-based hierarchical structure to adeptly capture multi-scale image information. In addition, the guided filters are utilized to steer the network, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the images. On the other hand, the WAM focuses on reconstructing saturated areas, improving the perceptual quality of the images, and rendering the reconstructed HDR images with naturalness and color saturation. Extensive experiments on multiple HDR image reconstruction datasets demonstrate HDRFormer’s substantial improvements, achieving up to a 2.7 dB increase in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and an enhancement of 0.09 in the structural similarity (SSIM) compared to existing methods. In addition, the framework exhibits outstanding performance in multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and HDR visual difference predictor (HDR-VDP2.2). The proposed method not only outperforms the existing HDR reconstruction techniques but also offers better generalization capabilities, laying a robust foundation for future applications in smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Effective response strategies to earthquake disasters are crucial for disaster management in smart cities. However, in regions where earthquakes do not occur frequently, model construction may be difficult due to a lack of training data. To address this issue, there is a need for technology that can generate earthquake scenarios for response training at any location. We proposed a model for generating earthquake scenarios using an auxiliary classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN)-based data synthesis. The proposed ACGAN model generates various earthquake scenarios by incorporating an auxiliary classifier learning process into the discriminator of GAN. Our results at borehole sensors showed that the seismic data generated by the proposed model had similar characteristics to actual data. To further validate our results, we compared the generated IM (such as PGA, PGV, and SA) with Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPE). Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of using the generated scenarios for earthquake early warning training. The proposed model and algorithm have significant potential in advancing seismic analysis and detection management systems, and also contribute to disaster management.",

With the use of these modules in ViT, it is successfully able to learn from stretch even on small-size (SS) datasets and overcome the lack of locality inductive bias.

Accurate traffic prediction can be deployed in urban applications such as congestion alerting and route planning, thus providing sustainable services to the public or relevant departments. Although some improvements have been made in existing traffic prediction methods, there are challenges due to the following: (1) Time series has multi-scale nature, that is, from different scale time ranges, traffic flow changes show different trends; (2) Spatial heterogeneity, meaning that traffic conditions in similar functional areas are usually similar. This task remains difficult. To address the above challenges, we propose a new spatial-temporal prediction method, namely Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Aware Transformer (MSSTAT), which is a Transformer architecture with multi-scale characteristics. Specifically, compared to the input of encoder, the input of different decoder layers has different scale information, MSSTAT synchronizes model the connection between time steps and scale information by a kind of Parallel Cross Multi-Head Attention, which gives each time step several times the perceived field while also being able to weaken the impact brought by anomaly point. In addition, to add connections between regions with similar functions, we map the traffic data of each node as a probability distribution and then measure the similarity between the nodes by the Wasserstein Distance, which leads to our proposed spatial-temporal aware adjacency matrix.

One of the keys to the efficient operation of smart city services is the accurate forecast of the missing Quality of Service (QoS). Presently, many approaches utilize the context information of users and services, such as geographic location and network location, to somewhat increase the prediction accuracy and forecast the missing QoS values. However, because the network conditions and server status are unpredictable, time is also considered as one of the important factors affecting QoS prediction, which brings more challenges as follows: higher data dimension, more complex data characteristics, and higher data sparsity. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for time-aware Web service QoS prediction based on contrastive learning (named CLpred). CLpred utilizes a sequential data input format for QoS data and models these QoS sequences through transformer encoder with CLpred framework. Therefore, it can downscale QoS data and extract a more efficient representation in complex QoS data.

Current systems adopt cameras and wireless sensors to estimate people's locations via sensor fusion. Standard fusion algorithms, however, become inapplicable when multi-modal data is not associated. For example, pedestrians are out of the camera field of view, or data from the camera modality is missing. To address this challenge and produce more accurate location estimations for pedestrians, we propose a localization solution based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. During training, it learns the underlying linkage between pedestrians' camera-phone data correspondences. During inference, it generates refined position estimations based only on pedestrians' phone data that consists of GPS, IMU, and FTM. Results show that our GAN produces 3D coordinates at 1 to 2 meters localization error across 5 different outdoor scenes. We further show that the proposed model supports self-learning. The generated coordinates can be associated with pedestrians' bounding box coordinates to obtain additional camera-phone data correspondences. This allows automatic data collection during inference. Results show that after fine-tuning the GAN model on the expanded dataset, localization accuracy is further improved by up to 26%.",

Results show that our GAN produces 3D coordinates at 1 to 2 meters localization error across 5 different outdoor scenes. We further show that the proposed model supports self-learning. The generated coordinates can be associated with pedestrians' bounding box coordinates to obtain additional camera-phone data correspondences. This allows automatic data collection during inference. Results show that after fine-tuning the GAN model on the expanded dataset, localization accuracy is further improved by up to 26%.",
    "introduction": "In Smart City and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems, acquiring pedestrians' accurate locations is crucial to traffic and pedestrian safety. Current systems adopt cameras and wireless sensors to estimate people's locations via sensor fusion. Standard fusion algorithms, however, become inapplicable when multi-modal data is not associated. For example, pedestrians are out of the camera field of view, or data from the camera modality is missing.",

    "abstract": "Tracking subjects in videos is one of the most widely used functions in camera-based IoT applications such as security surveillance, smart city traffic safety enhancement, vehicle to pedestrian communication and so on. In computer vision domain, tracking is usually achieved by first detecting subjects, then associating detected bounding boxes across video frames. Typically, frames are transmitted to a remote site for processing, incurring high latency and network costs. To address this, we propose ViFiT, a transformer-based model that reconstructs vision bounding box trajectories from phone data (IMU and Fine Time Measurements). It leverages a transformer's ability of better modeling long-term time series data. ViFiT is evaluated on Vi-Fi Dataset, a large-scale multimodal dataset in 5 diverse real world scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments. Results demonstrate that ViFiT outperforms the state-of-the-art approach for cross-modal reconstruction in LSTM Encoder-Decoder architecture X-Translator and achieves a high frame reduction rate as 97.76% with IMU and Wi-Fi data.",

Three-dimensional object detection in AVs is an essential task for comprehending the driving environment to contribute to their safe use in urban environments. Existing 3D LiDAR object detection systems lose many critical point features during the down-sampling process and neglect the crucial interactions between local features, providing insufficient semantic information and leading to subpar detection performance. We propose a dynamic feature abstraction with self-attention (DFA-SAT), which utilizes self-attention to learn semantic features with contextual information by incorporating neighboring data and focusing on vital geometric details. DFA-SAT comprises four modules: object-based down-sampling (OBDS), semantic and contextual feature extraction (SCFE), multi-level feature re-weighting (MLFR), and local and global features aggregation (LGFA). The OBDS module preserves the maximum number of semantic foreground points along with their spatial information. SCFE learns rich semantic and contextual information with respect to spatial dependencies, refining the point features. MLFR decodes all the point features using a channel-wise multi-layered transformer approach. LGFA combines local features with decoding weights for global features using matrix product keys and query embeddings to learn spatial information across each channel. Extensive experiments using the KITTI dataset demonstrate significant improvements over the mainstream methods SECOND and PointPillars, improving the mean average precision (AP) by 6.86% and 6.43%, respectively, on the KITTI test dataset.

Early fire detection is imperative to mitigate potential hazards and minimize associated losses. However, existing vision-based fire-detection methods exhibit limited generalizability and fail to adequately consider the effect of fire object size on detection accuracy. To address this issue, in this study a decoder-free fully transformer-based (DFFT) detector is used to achieve early smoke and flame detection, improving the detection performance for fires of different sizes. This method effectively captures multi-level and multi-scale fire features with rich semantic information while using two powerful encoders to maintain the accuracy of the single-feature map prediction. First, data augmentation is performed to enhance the generalizability of the model. Second, the detection-oriented transformer (DOT) backbone network is treated as a single-layer fire-feature extractor to obtain fire-related features on four scales, which are then fed into an encoder-only single-layer dense prediction module. Finally, the prediction module aggregates the multi-scale fire features into a single feature map using a scale-aggregated encoder (SAE). The prediction module then aligns the classification and regression features using a task-aligned encoder (TAE) to ensure the semantic interaction of the classification and regression predictions. Experimental results on one private dataset and one public dataset demonstrate that the adopted DFFT possesses high detection accuracy and a strong generalizability for fires of different sizes, particularly early small fires. The DFFT achieved mean average precision (mAP) values of 87.40% and 81.12% for the two datasets, outperforming other baseline models.

    "abstract": "Modeling time-evolving preferences of users with their sequential item interactions, has attracted increasing attention in many online applications. Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items. However, the interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential recommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type behavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users and items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance to accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference. In this work, we tackle the dynamic user-item relation learning with the awareness of multi-behavior interactive patterns. Towards this end, we propose a new Temporal Graph Transformer (TGT) recommendation framework to jointly capture dynamic short-term and long-range user-item interactive patterns, by exploring the evolving correlations across different types of behaviors. The new TGT method endows the sequential recommendation architecture to distill dedicated knowledge for type-specific behavior relational context and the implicit behavior dependencies.

    "introduction": "Modeling time-evolving preferences of users with their sequential item interactions, has attracted increasing attention in many online applications. Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items. However, the interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential recommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type behavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users and items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance to accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction-based and prediction-based approaches are widely used for video anomaly detection (VAD) in smart city surveillance applications. However, neither of these approaches can effectively utilize the rich contextual information that exists in videos, which makes it difficult to accurately perceive anomalous activities. In this paper, we exploit the idea of a training model based on the “Cloze Test” strategy in natural language processing (NLP) and introduce a novel unsupervised learning framework to encode both motion and appearance information at an object level. Specifically, to store the normal modes of video activity reconstructions, we first design an optical stream memory network with skip connections. Secondly, we build a space–time cube (STC) for use as the basic processing unit of the model and erase a patch in the STC to form the frame to be reconstructed. This enables a so-called ”incomplete event (IE)” to be completed. On this basis, a conditional autoencoder is utilized to capture the high correspondence between optical flow and STC. The model predicts erased patches in IEs based on the context of the front and back frames. Finally, we employ a generating adversarial network (GAN)-based training method to improve the performance of VAD. By distinguishing the predicted erased optical flow and erased video frame, the anomaly detection results are shown to be more reliable with our proposed method which can help reconstruct the original video in IE. Comparative experiments conducted on the benchmark UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets demonstrate AUROC scores reaching 97.7%, 89.7%, and 75.8%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) can classify each network’s flow behavior as benign or malicious by detecting heterogeneous features, including both categorical and numerical features. However, the present ML-based NIDSs are deemed insufficient in terms of their ability to generalize, particularly in changing network environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home. Although IoT devices add so much to home comforts, they also introduce potential risks and vulnerabilities. Recently, many NIDS studies on other IoT scenarios, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and smart cities, focus on utilizing the telemetry data of IoT devices for IoT intrusion detection. Because when IoT devices are under attack, their abnormal telemetry data values can reflect the anomaly state of those devices. Those telemetry data-based IoT NIDS methods detect intrusion events from a different view, focusing on the attack impact, from the traditional network traffic-based NIDS, which focuses on analyzing attack behavior. The telemetry data-based NIDS is more suitable for IoT devices without built-in security mechanisms. Considering the smart home IoT scenario, which has a smaller scope and a limited number of IoT devices compared to other IoT scenarios, both NIDS views can work independently. This motivated us to propose a novel ML-based NIDS to combine the network traffic-based and telemetry data-based NIDS together. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based IoT NIDS method to learn the behaviors and effects of attacks from different types of data that are generated in the heterogeneous IoT environment. The proposed method utilizes a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual embeddings for input network features. Based on the contextual embeddings, our method can solve the feature set challenge, including both continuous and categorical features. Our method is the first to utilize both network traffic data and IoT sensors’ telemetry data at the same time for intrusion detection. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our method on a realistic network traffic intrusion detection dataset named ToN_IoT, with an accuracy of 97.95% for binary classification and 95.78% for multiple classifications on pure network data.

Furthermore, although current surveillance systems can detect anomalous events, they require human intervention to recognise their nature and to select appropriate countermeasures, as there are no fully automatic surveillance techniques that can simultaneously detect and interpret anomalous events. Therefore, we present a framework called Vision Transformer Anomaly Recognition (ViT-ARN) that can detect and interpret anomalies in smart city surveillance videos. The framework consists of two stages: the first involves online anomaly detection, for which a customised, lightweight, one-class deep neural network is developed to detect anomalies in a surveillance environment, while in the second stage, the detected anomaly is further classified into the corresponding class. The size of our anomaly detection model is compressed using a filter pruning strategy based on a geometric median, with the aim of easy adaptability for resource-constrained devices. Anomaly classification is based on vision transformer features and is followed by a bottleneck attention mechanism to enhance the representation. The refined features are passed to a multi-reservoir echo state network for a detailed analysis of real-world anomalies such as vandalism and road accidents. A total of 858 and 1600 videos from two datasets are used to train the proposed model, and extensive experiments on the LAD-2000 and UCF-Crime datasets comprising 290 and 400 testing videos reveal that our framework can recognise anomalies more effectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches with increases in accuracy of 10.14% and 3% on the LAD-2000 and UCF-Crime datasets, respectively.",

First, collecting ground truth labels or prior knowledge for anomalies is hard in real-world systems, which often lead to limited or no anomaly labels in the dataset.

Lastly, real-time anomaly detection for high-dimensional data requires efficient algorithms that are capable of handling different types of data (i.e. continuous and discrete).

We propose an extended mutual information (EMI) metric to mine the internal correlation structure among different data features, which enhances the data reconstruction capability of CSCAD. The reconstruction loss and latent standard deviation vector of a sample obtained from reconstruction network can be perceived as two natural anomalous degree measures. An anomaly discriminating network can then be trained using low anomalous degree samples as positive samples, and high anomalous degree samples as negative samples.

Traffic prediction is an essential aspect of an intelligent transportation system in smart cities because it helps reduce overall traffic congestion. This article aims to design and enforce a traffic prediction scheme that is efficient and accurate in forecasting traffic flow. Available traffic flow prediction methods are still unsuitable for real-world applications. This fact motivated us to work on a traffic flow forecasting issue using Vision Transformers (VTs). In this work, VTs were used in conjunction with Convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict traffic congestion in urban spaces on a city-wide scale. In our proposed architecture, a traffic image is fed to a CNN, which generates feature maps. These feature maps are then fed to the VT, which employs the dual techniques of tokenization and projection. Tokenization is used to convert features into tokens containing Vision information, which are then sent to projection, where they are transformed into feature maps and ultimately delivered to LSTM. The experimental results demonstrate that the vision transformer prediction method based on Spatio-temporal characteristics is an excellent way of predicting traffic flow, particularly during anomalous traffic situations.

    "abstract": "Acquiring road information is important for smart cities and sustainable urban development. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the extraction of urban road information from remote sensing images using deep learning (DL) algorithms. However, due to the complex shape, narrowness, and high span of roads in the images, the results are often unsatisfactory. This article proposes a Seg-Road model to improve road connectivity. The Seg-Road uses a transformer structure to extract the long-range dependency and global contextual information to improve the fragmentation of road segmentation and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure to extract local contextual information to improve the segmentation of road details. Furthermore, a novel pixel connectivity structure (PCS) is proposed to improve the connectivity of road segmentation and the robustness of prediction results. To verify the effectiveness of Seg-Road for road segmentation, the DeepGlobe and Massachusetts datasets were used for training and testing. The experimental results show that Seg-Road achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an intersection over union (IoU) of 67.20%, mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 82.06%, F1 of 91.43%, precision of 90.05%, and recall of 92.85% in the DeepGlobe dataset, and achieves an IoU of 68.38%, MIoU of 83.89%, F1 of 90.01%, precision of 87.34%, and recall of 92.86% in the Massachusetts dataset, which is better than the values for CoANet.

    "abstract": "Next location prediction is helpful for service recommendation, public safety, intelligent transportation, and other location-based applications. Existing location prediction methods usually use sparse check-in trajectories and require massive historical data to capture complex spatial-temporal correlations. High spatial-temporal resolution trajectories have rich information. However, obtaining personal trajectories with long time series and high spatiotemporal resolution usually proves challenging. Herein, this paper proposes a two-stage Context-Aware Spatial-Temporal Location Embedding (CASTLE) model, a multi-modal pre-training model for sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. The method is built in two steps. First, large-scale location datasets, which are sparse but easier to be acquired (i.e., check-in and anomalous navigation data), are used for pre-training location embedding to capture the multi-functional properties under different contexts. After that, the learned contextual embedding is used for downstream location prediction in small-scale but higher spatiotemporal resolution trajectory datasets. Specifically, the CASTLE model combines Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers to generate contextual embedding vectors rather than a fixed vector for each location. Furthermore, we introduce a location and time-aware encoder to reflect the spatial distances between locations and visit times. Experiments are conducted on two real trajectory datasets. The results show that the CASTLE model can pre-train beneficial location embedding and outperforms the model without pre-training by 4.6-7.1%. The proposed method is expected to improve the next location prediction accuracy without massive historical data, which will greatly drive the use of trajectory data.",

    "abstract": "Smart cities represent the zenith of technological integration, aiming to uplift living experiences and operational efficiency within urban regions. With music being intrinsically intertwined with societal living, embedding it seamlessly into digitized cities remains a challenge. The rapid evolution of music generation algorithms based on Transformer models has opened a promising avenue in this context. However, applying music generation to smart cities presents two problems: 1) Previous work only considers forward information by adopting an upper-triangular mask. Although this can avoid information leakage, global information of music pieces may not be well captured, harming the overall structure and quality of generated samples and making it challenging to generate complete melodies in longer segments. 2) Due to the randomness of sampling, the generated music sometimes has discordant notes, affecting the practical usage experience. To alleviate these problems, we introduce the masked global information network on the transformer language model to incorporate global information constraints in a joint training manner. With this succinct approach, complete melodies with reasonable repetition and musical structure can be generated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the global information network can be extended as a post-processing module by reusing the hidden layer states from prior networks to further improve the quality of samples in a non-autoregressive way.

Currently, the fundamental obstacle lies in effectively modelling the complex spatial-temporal dependencies present in traffic flow data. Deep learning models such as Graph Neural Network based models and Transformer based models have shown promising results in this field. However, methods founded on a single model or framework have one significant limitation: Such methods cannot adequately represent the spatial and temporal features of traffic flow data, restricting the model's ability to learn the dynamics of urban transportation.

    "introduction": "Traffic flow prediction, which plays an important role in intelligent traffic systems, has become a pressing problem to be addressed with the continuous development of smart cities. Currently, the fundamental obstacle lies in effectively modelling the complex spatial-temporal dependencies present in traffic flow data. Deep learning models such as Graph Neural Network based models and Transformer based models have shown promising results in this field. However, methods founded on a single model or framework have one significant limitation: Such methods cannot adequately represent the spatial and temporal features of traffic flow data, restricting the model's ability to learn the dynamics of urban transportation.",

In order to manage those challenges, a new distributed failure tolerant path planning framework has been modelled to generate the virtual path for automated vehicles like drone and grounded vehicles. Due to advent of artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies in the software defined networks, efficient management of the automated vehicle is feasible using existing telecommunication network like 3G/4G and LTE networks.

Existing surveys on learning approaches in video surveillance have some drawbacks, such as a lack of in-depth analysis of the learning algorithms, omission of certain methodologies, insufficient critical evaluation, and absence of recent learning algorithms. To fill these gaps, this survey provides a thorough examination of the most recent learning algorithms for anomaly detection. A critical assessment of the algorithms including their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability as well as tailored classifications of anomaly types for different domains are provided. Our study also offers insights into the future development of learning techniques in VSS, positioning itself as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the field.

    "abstract": "Structural defects in civil infrastructure, such as highways, roads, bridges, and dams, can severely impact their reliability and safety. Manual inspection of such infrastructure is labor-intensive and costly, creating the demand for automated damage-tracking systems. Data-driven techniques, such as machine learning, and statistical methods have been utilized in a remarkable number of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications. However, real-time and high-accuracy concrete crack detection poses severe challenges for deployment on embedded systems and mobile robotic platforms, due to their computational constraints, low-latency requirements, and the robustness of model predictions in field deployments. This work proposes a robust and low-latency transformer-based deep-crack segmentation model that leverages both Red Green Blue (RGB) and Hyper Spectral (HYP) data for crack detection. The model is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems, enabling structural health monitoring on robotic platforms, and studies the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of the estimated crack maps. The final model is deployed on one of the most popular robotic embedded computation platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 99.54% at an inference time of only 7.41ms using the RGB camera only.

Distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging infrastructure play a vital role in the planning and construction of smart cities. However, the uncertainty associated with the power output of distributed generation significantly impacts the planning of distribution networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability.

It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

    "abstract": "Due to the high inherent uncertainty of renewable energy, probabilistic day-ahead wind power forecasting is crucial for modeling and controlling the uncertainty of renewable energy smart grids in smart cities. However, the accuracy and reliability of high-resolution day-ahead wind power forecasting are constrained by unreliable local weather prediction and incomplete power generation data. This article proposes a physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) surrogates method to augment the incomplete dataset and quantify its uncertainty to improve wind power forecasting performance. The incomplete dataset, built with numerical weather prediction data, historical wind power generation, and weather factors data, is augmented based on generative adversarial networks. After augmentation, the enriched data is then fed into a multiple AI surrogates model constructed by two extreme learning machine networks to train the forecasting model for wind power. Therefore, the forecasting models’ accuracy and generalization ability are improved by mining the implicit physics information from the incomplete dataset. An incomplete dataset gathered from a wind farm in North China, containing only 15 days of weather and wind power generation data with missing points caused by occasional shutdowns, is utilized to verify the proposed method’s performance. Compared with other probabilistic forecasting methods, the proposed method shows better accuracy and probabilistic performance on the same incomplete dataset, which highlights its potential for more flexible and sensitive maintenance of smart grids in smart cities.",

    "contribution": "This article proposes a physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) surrogates method to augment the incomplete dataset and quantify its uncertainty to improve wind power forecasting performance. The incomplete dataset, built with numerical weather prediction data, historical wind power generation, and weather factors data, is augmented based on generative adversarial networks. After augmentation, the enriched data is then fed into a multiple AI surrogates model constructed by two extreme learning machine networks to train the forecasting model for wind power. Therefore, the forecasting models’ accuracy and generalization ability are improved by mining the implicit physics information from the incomplete dataset. An incomplete dataset gathered from a wind farm in North China, containing only 15 days of weather and wind power generation data with missing points caused by occasional shutdowns, is utilized to verify the proposed method’s performance. Compared with other probabilistic forecasting methods, the proposed method shows better accuracy and probabilistic performance on the same incomplete dataset, which highlights its potential for more flexible and sensitive maintenance of smart grids in smart cities.",
    "introduction": "Due to the high inherent uncertainty of renewable energy, probabilistic day-ahead wind power forecasting is crucial for modeling and controlling the uncertainty of renewable energy smart grids in smart cities. However, the accuracy and reliability of high-resolution day-ahead wind power forecasting are constrained by unreliable local weather prediction and incomplete power generation data.",

However, existing methods fail to capture the internal structural features of sparse UFHs and the external factors that lead to a significant waste of urban resources. To this end, we propose an enhanced super-resolution framework (Urban Flow-aware Super Resolution - Generative Adversarial Network, UrbanSG) to deduce fine-grained UFH for urban resource allocation. Specifically, we employ a conditional-GAN as the backbone, considering external factors as the specified condition.

    "abstract": "Street tree extraction based on the 3-D mobile mapping point cloud plays an important role in building smart cities and creating highly accurate urban street maps. Existing methods are often over- or under-segmented when segmenting overlapping street tree canopies and extracting geometrically complex trees. To address this problem, we propose a method based on improved 3-D morphological analysis for extracting street trees from mobile laser scanner (MLS) point clouds. First, the 3-D semantic point cloud segmentation framework based on deep learning is used for preclassification of the original point cloud to obtain the vegetation point cloud in the scene. Considering the influence of terrain unevenness, the vegetation point cloud is deterraformed and slice point cloud containing tree trunks is obtained through spatial filtering on height. On this basis, a voxel-based region growing method constrained with the changing rate of convex area is used to locate the stree trees. Then we propose a progressive tree crown segmentation method, which first completed the preliminary individual segmentation of the tree crown point cloud based on the voxel-based region growth constrained by the minimum increment rule, and then optimizes the crown edges by 'valley' structure-based clustering. In this article, the proposed method is validated and the accuracy is evaluated using three sets of MLS datasets collected from different scenarios. The experimental results show that the method can effectively identify and localize street trees with different geometries and has a good segmentation effect for street trees with large adhesion between canopies. The accuracy and recall of tree localization are higher than 96.08% and 95.83%, respectively, and the average precision and recall of instance segmentation in three datasets are higher than 93.23% and 95.41%, respectively.",

However, increase in smart grids causes several power quality problems on the smart grid, in particular, current and voltage harmonic distortions, sudden voltage sag and swells, fault current, and isolation deterioration. Smart transformers are potential solutions to improve the power quality on the electric grid. They present energy efficiency, ensure grid reliability and power flow control, voltage regulation, bidirectional power flow, fault current limiting, harmonic blocking, and galvanic isolation. Therefore, this paper offers an optimal selection of a three-stage (AC-DC-DC-AC) smart transformer model and power control strategy for solar PV power plant integrated smart grids.

Firstly, the shifted window operation is used for coarsening the time series data, thus, the computational complexity can be reduced. Then, a multi-channel graph convolutional network is adopted to capture and aggregate the spatial correlations of the roads in multiple dimensions. Finally, the improved graph Transformer based on the advanced Transformer model is proposed to extract the long-term temporal correlation of traffic data effectively.

    "abstract": "With the increase of large camera networks around us, it is becoming more difficult to manually identify vehicles. Computer vision enables us to automate this task. More specifically, vehicle re-identification (ReID) aims to identify cars in a camera network with non-overlapping views. Images captured of vehicles can undergo intense variations of appearance due to illumination, pose, or viewpoint. Furthermore, due to small inter-class similarities and large intra-class differences, feature learning is often enhanced with non-visual cues, such as the topology of camera networks and temporal information. These are, however, not always available or can be resource intensive for the model. Following the success of Transformer baselines in ReID, we propose for the first time an outlook-attention-based vehicle ReID framework using the Vision Outlooker as its backbone, which is able to encode finer-level features. We show that, without embedding any additional side information and using only the visual cues, we can achieve an 80.31% mAP and 97.13% R-1 on the VeRi-776 dataset.

Foreseeing private car transfer between urban regions can facilitate a broad scope of applications ranging from route planning, hot region discovery to urban computing.

In this paper, we model private cars’ travel in urban regions as the spatio-temporal graph and formulate private car transfer foreseeing as the time-evolving adjacency matrix prediction of the graph.

For one thing, we design multi-graph dense convolutions with gated recurrent networks as the generative network to capture multiple spatio-temporal correlations. For another, the attentive multi-graph convolutional network is designed as the discriminative network to learn the stay duration correlations of private cars in each region. The iterative adversarial processes between generating and discriminating networks enhance the MG-GAN’s ability to tackle the sparse data problem.

First, from a high-resolution perspective, the buildings in informal settlement areas are low-floor and dense, with complex spatial relationships. Second, informal settlements’ remote sensing observation characteristics are highly inconspicuous, caused by the shooting angle and imaging environment. Therefore, it is inadequate to classify UIS using only a single remote sensing image modality. Multimodality data with multiple temporal and spatial characteristics provide a prospective opportunity for the more accurate mapping of UIS. Still, there is a lack of relevant works on UIS classification at present. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid Transformer-based spatio-temporal fusion network, namely, STNet, which integrates a proposed PDNet, ResMixer, and Transformer-based spatio-temporal fusing layer to classify UIS using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images and time-series Tencent population density (TPD) data. Experiments were conducted in Shenzhen City, confirming the superior performance of the proposed STNet and the fusing of spatio-temporal multimodal remote sensing and time-series TPD data. The proposed STNet reached an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.58% and Kappa of 0.7716, with increases of around 1% to 12% and around 0.03 to 0.25 in OA and Kappa, respectively, compared to other models.",

    "abstract": "The generation of topographic classification maps or relative heights from aerial or remote sensing images represents a crucial research tool in remote sensing. On the one hand, from auto-driving, three-dimensional city modeling, road design, and resource statistics to smart cities, each task requires relative height data and classification data of objects. On the other hand, most relative height data acquisition methods currently use multiple images. We find that relative height and geographic classification data can be mutually assisted through data distribution. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has become possible to estimate the relative height from a single image. It learns implicit mapping relationships in a data-driven manner that may not be explicitly available through mathematical modeling. On this basis, we propose a unified, in-depth learning structure that can generate both estimated relative height maps and semantically segmented maps and perform end-to-end training. Compared with the existing methods, our task is to perform both relative height estimation and semantic segmentation tasks simultaneously. We only need one picture to obtain the corresponding semantically segmented images and relative heights simultaneously. The model’s performance is much better than that of equivalent computational models. We also designed dynamic weights to enable the model to learn relative height estimation and semantic segmentation simultaneously. At the same time, we have conducted good experiments on existing datasets.

In order to improve vehicle environment perception technology in real hazy scenes, we propose an effective detection algorithm based on Swin Transformer for hazy vehicle detection. This algorithm includes two aspects. First of all, for the aspect of the difficulty in extracting haze features with poor visibility, a dehazing network is designed to obtain high-quality haze-free output through encoding and decoding methods using Swin Transformer blocks. In addition, for the aspect of the difficulty of vehicle detection in hazy images, a new end-to-end vehicle detection model in hazy days is constructed by fusing the dehazing module and the Swin Transformer detection module. In the training stage, the self-made dataset Haze-Car is used, and the haze detection model parameters are initialized by using the dehazing model and Swin-T through transfer learning. Finally, the final haze detection model is obtained by fine tuning.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent city construction and public crisis management. Distinct from the single trajectory prediction which rely on strong temporal correlation, in the complex scenes, the trajectory reflects not only the temporal characteristics of a single person, but the interactive features between human and other moving objects nearby. Therefore, how to deeply describe such temporality and interactivity, and then to generate accurate trajectory prediction results according to the change of the scene has become a major problem in the field of trajectory prediction today. In recent years, deep learning has attracted great attention and achieved success in the trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods capture the influence between pedestrians from a single view, and they fail to consider the multiple factors which have an effect on the decision of pedestrians, such as going straight or turning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time.",

    "abstract": "Cases of missing children not being found are rare, but they continue to occur. If the child is not found immediately, the parents may not be able to identify the child’s appearance because they have not seen their child for a long time. Therefore, our purpose is to predict children’s faces when they grow up and help parents search for missing children. DNA paternity testing is the most accurate way to detect whether two people have a blood relation. However, DNA paternity testing for every unidentified child would be costly. Therefore, we propose the development of the Face Prediction System for Missing Children in a Smart City Safety Network. It can predict the faces of missing children at their current age, and parents can quickly confirm the possibility of blood relations with any unidentified child. The advantage is that it can eliminate incorrect matches and narrow down the search at a low cost. Our system combines StyleGAN2 and FaceNet methods to achieve prediction. StyleGAN2 is used to style mix two face images. FaceNet is used to compare the similarity of two face images. Experiments show that the similarity between predicted and expected results is more than 75%. This means that the system can well predict children’s faces when they grow up.

    "contribution": "Therefore, we propose the development of the Face Prediction System for Missing Children in a Smart City Safety Network. It can predict the faces of missing children at their current age, and parents can quickly confirm the possibility of blood relations with any unidentified child. The advantage is that it can eliminate incorrect matches and narrow down the search at a low cost. Our system combines StyleGAN2 and FaceNet methods to achieve prediction. StyleGAN2 is used to style mix two face images. FaceNet is used to compare the similarity of two face images. Experiments show that the similarity between predicted and expected results is more than 75%. This means that the system can well predict children’s faces when they grow up. Our system has more natural and higher similarity comparison results than Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder (CAAE), High Resolution Face Age Editing (HRFAE) and Identity-Preserved Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (IPCGAN).",
    "introduction": "Cases of missing children not being found are rare, but they continue to occur. If the child is not found immediately, the parents may not be able to identify the child’s appearance because they have not seen their child for a long time. Therefore, our purpose is to predict children’s faces when they grow up and help parents search for missing children. DNA paternity testing is the most accurate way to detect whether two people have a blood relation. However, DNA paternity testing for every unidentified child would be costly.",

    "abstract": "With the growth of urban population, a series of urban problems have emerged, and how to speed up smart city construction has received extensive attention. Remote sensing images have the advantages of wide spatial coverage and rich information, and it is suitable for use as research data for smart cities. However, due to limitations in the imaging sensor conditions and complex weather, remote sensing images face the problems of insufficient resolution and cloud occlusion, which cannot meet the resolution requirements of smart city tasks. The remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) technique can improve the details and texture information without upgrading the imaging sensor system, which becomes a feasible solution for the above problems. In this paper, we propose a novel remote sensing image super-resolution method which leverages the texture features from internal and external references to help with SR reconstruction. We introduce the transformer attention mechanism to select and extract parts of texture features with high reference values to ensure that the network is lightweight, effective, and easier to deploy on edge computing devices. In addition, our network can automatically learn and adjust the alignment angles and scales of texture features for better SR results. Extensive comparison experiments show that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art SR methods. In addition, we also evaluate the application value of our proposed SR method in urban region function recognition in smart cities. The dataset used in this task is low-quality.

    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification (ReID) focuses on searching for images of the same vehicle across different cameras and can be considered as the most fine-grained ID-level classification task. It is fundamentally challenging due to the significant differences in appearance presented by a vehicle with the same ID (especially from different viewpoints) coupled with the subtle differences between vehicles with different IDs. Spatial attention mechanisms that have been proven to be effective in computer vision tasks also play an important role in vehicle ReID. However, they often require expensive key-point labels or suffer from noisy attention masks when trained without key-point labels. In this work, we propose a transformer-based attention network (TAN) for learning spatial attention information and hence for facilitating learning of discriminative features for vehicle ReID. Specifically, in contrast to previous studies that adopted a transformer network, we designed the attention network as an independent branch that can be flexibly utilized in various tasks. Moreover, we combined the TAN with two other branches: one to extract global features that define the image-level structures, and the other to extract the auxiliary side-attribute features that are invariant to viewpoint, such as color, car type, etc. To validate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on two vehicle datasets (the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets) and a person dataset (Market-1501).

For these tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the dominant solution for the past decade, for their remarkable ability in learning discriminative features from images to boost retrieval performance. However, it is been discovered that DNNs are broadly vulnerable to maliciously constructed adversarial examples. By adding small perturbations to a query image, the returned retrieval results will be completely dissimilar from the query image. This poses serious challenges to vital systems in Smart City applications that depend on the DNN-based visual retrieval technology, as in the physical world, simple camouflage can be added on the subject (a few patches on the body or car), and turn the subject completely untrackable by person or vehicle Re-ID systems. To demonstrate the potential of such threats, this paper proposes a novel adversarial patch generative adversarial network (AP-GAN) to generate adversarial patches instead of modifying the entire image, which also causes the DNNs-based image retrieval models to return incorrect results. AP-GAN is trained in an unsupervised way that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image scene classification is an important and challenging problem of remote sensing image interpretation. With the generation of a large number of scene-rich high-resolution remote sensing images, scene classification of remote sensing images is widely used in many fields such as smart city construction, natural disaster monitoring and land resource utilization. Due to the advancement of deep learning techniques and the establishment of large-scale scene classification datasets, scene classification methods have been significantly improved. Although the classification methods based on deep learning have achieved high classification accuracy, the supervised methods require a large number of training samples, while the unsupervised classification methods are difficult to meet the practical needs and have low classification accuracy. Meanwhile, the annotation of remote sensing images requires rich engineering skills and expert knowledge, and in remote sensing applications, only a small amount of labeled remote sensing images exist for supervised training in most cases, and a large amount of unlabeled images cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, a semi-supervised learning method that extracts effective features from a large amount of unlabeled data by learning a small amount of labeled data becomes a potential way to solve such problems. To address the problems of complex background of remote sensing images and the inability of supervised scene classification algorithms to utilize unlabeled data, a semi-supervised remote sensing image scene classification method based on generative adversarial networks, namely, residual attention generative adversarial networks, is proposed. First, to enhance the stability of training, the residual blocks with jump structure are introduced in the deep neural network. At the same time, the spectral normalization constrains the spectral norm of the weight matrix in each convolutional layer of the residual block to ensure that the input and output of each batch of data satisfy the 1-Lipschitz continuity, which makes the generative adversarial training always smooth, not only improves the training stability, but also avoids network degradation. Secondly, since the shallow features extracted by the bottom convolution contain mostly local information and low semantics, while the deep features extracted by the top convolution contain more global information but lose part of the detail information. Therefore, the shallow features are fused with the deep features extracted from the multi-layer spectral normalized residual blocks to reduce the loss of features and allow the model to learn the complementary relationships between different features, thus improving the model's representational ability. Finally, to guide the model to focus more purposefully on important features and suppress unnecessary features, an attention module that mimics the signal processing of the human brain is used. Meanwhile, in order to obtain stronger feature representation ability and capture the dependency relationship between features, a gating mechanism is introduced to form an attention module combined with gating. To verify the superiority of the method, experiments were conducted on two high-resolution remote sensing image datasets, EuroSAT and UC Merced. In the EuroSAT dataset, the highest classification accuracy reached 93.3% and 97.4% when the number of labeled features was 2 000 and 21 600, respectively. In the UC Merced dataset, the classification accuracies reached 85.7% and 91.0% when the number of labeled was 400 and 1 680, respectively. To further validate the degree of contribution of each module, ablation experiments were also conducted in the EuroSAT and UCM public datasets, and it can be concluded from the validation that the spectral normalization residual module has the largest contribution, with improvement for different number of labeled samples. The reason is that the spectral normalization ensures that the gradient of the network is limited to a certain range during backpropagation, improving the stability of the generative adversarial network, and also does not destroy the network structure in the process. The next is the attention module combined with gating, especially when the labeled sample size is greater than 10%, the classification effect is improved more because the sample size is sufficient to learn more comprehensive features. The smallest contribution is the feature fusion module, because when the sample size is very small, the network is not sufficiently trained and learned, and a part of redundant or invalid features are extracted, resulting in lower classification accuracy. The above experimental results show that the proposed residual attention generation adversarial network classification method can effectively extract more discriminative features and improve the semi-supervised classification performance for the problem of small sample size of labeled high-resolution remote sensing images, which makes it difficult to extract discriminative features.",

Although previous studies have achieved success in integrating spatial-temporal information to some extents, those models lack thoughtful consideration on global information and positional information in the temporal dimension, which can be summarized by three aspects: a) The models do not consider the relative position information of time axis, resulting in that the position features of flow maps are not effectively learned. b) They overlook the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales, which lead to inaccurate global information representation. c) Those models only predict the flow map at the end of time sequence other than more flow maps before that, which results in neglecting parts of temporal features in the learning process. To solve the problems, we propose a novel model, Spatial-Temporal Global Semantic representation learning for urban flow Prediction (ST-GSP) in this paper. Specifically, for a), we design a semantic flow encoder that extracts relative positional information of time. Besides, the encoder captures the spatial dependencies and external factors of urban flow at each time interval. For b), we model the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales simultaneously by using the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which can learn the global temporal dependencies. For c), inspired by the idea of self-supervised learning, we mask an urban flow map on the time sequence and predict it to pre-train a deep bidirectional learning model to catch the representation from its context. We conduct extensive experiments on two types of urban flows in Beijing and New York City to show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The power grid, one of the most crucial components of smart cities, faces significant challenges in operating efficiently, dependably, and economically. One of these challenges is forecasting the demand for electricity. Grid managers can balance supply and demand properly while also minimizing operating expenses for generating and transmitting power. Thanks to accurate forecasts, while maintaining respectable system performance in terms of the limitations on the actual and reactive power output of the generator, bus voltages, shunt capacitors and reactors, transformer tap setting, and transmission line power flow. For a sustainable future and to meet the higher carbon emission standards that are being put in place, it is expected that the renewable energy sector will experience enormous development. The placement of wind turbines in a wind farm requires the use of evolutionary algorithms and power system optimization issues because the wake effect caused by upstream turbines impacts the output of downstream turbines, consequently diminishing the total power output from the wind farm. The current study using MFO determines a cost of $ 3160.0824 $/h for minimizing the cost of multiple fuels, which turns out to be the best price when compared to the legitimate results obtained by other algorithms. It results in a cost savings of 1.45% per hour when compared to the worst alternatives given by the comparison algorithm. According to simulation results on the IEEE 30-bus network with six generators, this approach might offer the best solution right away. A further study found that this method works best for medium-scale power installations.",

The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a layered network providing efficient and safe airways for various drone inter-operable services. Automated Drone Classification (ADC) is a prerequisite in the IoD system that not only monitors flights and avoids collisions between drones but also detects malicious drone flights. In this work, we propose a Dual-stream Convolutional Transformer (DCT) model to carry out ADC tasks based on drone remote control signals. The DCT combines the self-attention mechanism and convolution to capture long-range dependencies of different frequencies/time steps and local invariant features. We evaluated the proposed method on two public datasets and compared the results with the baseline studies. The DCT model outperforms other baselines with the improvement of 3 % accuracy in multiclass classification and reaches 94.49 % and 98.73 % on two different datasets at 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the experiments also show the great potential of DCT model on out-of-distribution by the improvement of 7 % accuracy.

Many studies focus on single-modal (i.e., visible) vehicle re-identification, which are prone to be deteriorated under bad illumination conditions. Therefore, visible, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared multi-modal vehicle re-identification is worthy to study. This paper proposes a hybrid vision transformer (H-ViT) based multi-modal vehicle re-identification. The proposed H-ViT has two new modules: (1) modal-specific controller (MC) and (2) modal information embedding (MIE) structure. In the feature extraction process, the MC flexibly specifies modal-specific layers for different modal data and controls the sharing attribute of the position embedding to alleviate the difficulty brought by heterogeneous multi-modalities. The MIE structure learns inter- and intra-modal information to reduce feature deviations toward modal variations. Experimental results show that our H-ViT method achieves good performance on multi-modal vehicle re-identification datasets (i.e., RGBNT100 and RGBN300) by integrating MC and MIE modules, which are superior to existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of Internet-connected devices (i.e., smart phones, smart cars, etc.) in today's society has given rise to a massive amount of data that can be harnessed by intelligent systems to learn and model the behavior of people. One useful set of such data is movement data, which can readily be obtained via GPS or motion-detection sensors, and which can be used to create models of user movement. One relevant application task based on this type of data is destination prediction, where movement data are used to form highly customized models that can forecast intended user destinations based on partially observed trajectories. In this work, we present a two-stage predictive model for destination prediction and Time-To-Destination (TTD) estimation using movement trajectories and contextual information. Our two-stage approach uses a Transformer-based architecture to predict an intended destination and a regression model to estimate how many steps must be traversed before a destination is reached. We showcase experimental results on various trajectory datasets and show that our proposed approach is able to yield significant destination prediction improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods and can also produce accurate TTD estimates.",

Second, we compare the performance of the Vision in Transformer (ViT) network against the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of critical vehicle classification.

A reliable person re-identification system relieves users from the inefficient work of identifying the specific individual from enormous numbers of photos or videos captured by different surveillance devices. The most existing methods either focus on local discriminative features without global contextual information or scatter global features while ignoring the local features, resulting in ineffective attention to irregular pedestrian zones. In this article, a novel Transformer-CNN Coupling Network (TCCNet) is proposed to capture the fluctuant body region features in a heterogeneous feature-aware manner. We employ two bridging modules, the Lowlevel Feature Coupling Module (LFCM) and the High-level Feature Coupling Module (HFCM), to improve the complementary characteristics of the hybrid network. It is significantly helpful to enhance the capacity to distinguish between foreground and background features, thereby reducing the unfavorable impact of cluttered backgrounds on person re-identification. Furthermore, the duplicate loss for the two branches is employed to incorporate semantic information from distant preferences of the two branches into the resulting person representation. The experiments on two large-scale person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TCCNet achieves competitive results compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Accurate multi-step citywide urban flow prediction plays a critical role in traffic management and future smart city. However, it is very challenging since urban flow is affected by complex semantic factors and has multi-scale dependencies on both spatial and temporal dimensional features. Moreover, it’s difficult for most existing one-step urban flow prediction models to predict several future time steps in a short time accurately. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in video prediction and image generation, in this paper we propose a Seq2Seq Spatial-Temporal Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks named STS-GAN for multi-step urban flow prediction. We regard citywide urban flow data in successive time steps as image frames of a video. Specifically, we first design a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Encoder (STSE) to capture relative semantic factors and spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously at each time step, which consists of Residual Convolution units. Then a Seq2Seq GAN model is proposed to generate a sequence of future urban flow predictions based on historical data. Furthermore, by integrating GAN’s adversarial loss with prediction error, our STS-GAN can effectively address the blurry prediction issue.

The Transformer, which has demonstrated superiority in capturing long-term dependencies, was recently studied for spatio-temporal prediction. However, it is difficult to leverage it using both multi-resolution knowledge and spatio-temporal dependencies to aid LTSTP. The challenge typically lies in addressing two issues: (1) efficiently fusing information across multiple resolutions that demands elaborate and complicated modifications to the model, and (2) handling the necessary long-term sequence that makes concurrent space and time attentions too costly to be performed. To address these issues, we proposed a multi-resolution recursive spatio-temporal transformer (Mu2ReST). It implements a novel multi-resolution structure with recursive prediction from coarser to finer resolutions. This proposal reveals that an arduous modification of the model is not the only way to leverage multi-resolution knowledge.

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning technologies generally learn the features of chest X-ray data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia).

To tackle these challenges, we design a low-cost crowdsensing system by missing data inference incorporating with active sensing grids selection. Specifically, an adversarial autoencoder (AAE)-based scheme is proposed for missing data inference. This model applies VAE to learn latent variables and generates full data and further utilizes the adversarial nets to play a min-max game with the autoencoder. Furthermore, an active learning-based method is designed to iteratively select sensing grids to further reduce the cost.

A promising approach for handling this problem is to introduce intelligent methods to implement a highly effective and efficient cellular traffic prediction model. Meanwhile, integrating the multiaccess edge computing framework in 5G cellular networks facilitates the application of intelligent traffic prediction models by enabling their implementation at the network edge. However, the data shortage and privacy issues may still be obstacles for training a robust and accurate prediction model at the edge.

    "abstract": "Objective: Remote sensing building object segmentation is one of the important applications in image processing, which plays a vital role in smart city planning and urban change detection. However, building objects in remote sensing images have many complex characteristics, such as variable sizes, dense distributions, diverse topological shapes, complex backgrounds, and presence of occlusions and shadows. Traditional building segmentation algorithms are mainly based on manually designed features such as shapes, edges, and shadow features. These features are shallow features of the building target and cannot well express high-level semantic information, resulting in low recognition accuracy. By contrast, deep convolutional networks show excellent performance in pixel-level classification of natural images. Various fully convolutional network based image segmentation models have been continuously proposed. Most of these models use deconvolution or bilinear interpolation after feature extraction. Feature upsampling and pixel-by-pixel classification are used to segment the input image. The deep features of the building are extracted using highly nonlinear mapping and a large amount of data training, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional algorithms. However, upsampling cannot completely compensate the information loss caused by repeated convolution and pooling operations in the deep convolutional network model. Therefore, the prediction results are relatively rough, such as small target misclassification, inaccurate boundaries, and other issues. In the field of remote sensing, public data sets are few. Training excellent deep convolutional networks is difficult, and the robustness of the network needs to be further improved. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a conditional generative adversarial network (Ra-CGAN) with multilevel channel attention mechanism to segment remote sensing building objects. Method: A generative model with a multilevel channel attention mechanism is first built. The model is based on a coding and decoding structure that solves small target misses by fusing deep semantics and shallow details with attention. Second, a discriminative network is built and used to distinguish whether the input comes from the real label map or the segmentation map generated by the model. The segmentation result (accuracy and smoothness) is improved by correcting the difference between the two maps. The downsampling method without pooling is used in the discriminator to enhance the propagation of the gradient. Finally, the generated model and the discriminant model are alternately confronted for training through the constraint of the conditional variable of the labelled image. Learning the higher-order data distribution characteristics results in more continuity for the target space. The loss function uses a hybrid loss function, which comes from the cross-entropy loss function brought by the generated map and the real label map in the generation mode. The discriminator predicts the generated image as the loss value brought by the real label image. Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets. The first dataset has a dense building with many types and accurate labels, and can provide comprehensive, representative evaluation capabilities for the model. Another dataset with a higher segmentation difficulty is used to verify the robustness and scalability of the model. The lighting information and background information of the building are more complex than those of the first dataset. The experiment uses the PyTorch deep learning framework. The size of original image and the label image are unified to 512 × 512 pixels for training, the learning rate of Adam is set to 0.000 2, the momentum parameter is 0.5, the batch-size is 12, and the epoch is 200 times. Acceleration is performed using NVIDIA GTX TITAN Xp. Evaluation indicators include intersection over union (IOU), precision, recall, and F1-score. Result: Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets, and the methods are compared with the latest literature. Experimental results show that in the WHU dataset, the segmentation performance of the Ra-CGAN model is substantially improved compared with models without attention mechanism and adversarial training. Space continuity and integrity of the complex building and small building, and smoothness of building edges are considerably improved. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 3.75%, and F1-score is increased by 2.52%. Compared with the second-performance model, IOU value is increased by 1.1%, and F1-score is increased by 1.1%. In the Satellite Dataset II, Ra-CGAN obtains more ideal results in terms of target integrity and smoothness than other models, especially in the case of insufficient data samples. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 7.26%, and F1-score is increased by 6.68%. Compared with the second-placed model, IOU value is increased by 1.7% and F1-score is increased by 1.6%.

This fact led researchers to propose various topologies of transformer-less inverters, which have been validated for only injection of real power towards grid. However, recently new regulation has been imposed by all international power regulatory agency is that these PV inverters integrated with grid should have the capability of handling flow of a certain quantity of reactive power. By considering this point, a noble topology of transformer-less inverter has been developed for grid integrated PV system.

    "introduction": "The importance of transformer-less inverters has been increased since these are highly efficient, less costly, reduced in weight compared to conventional inverters for PV systems connected to grid. This fact led researchers to propose various topologies of transformer-less inverters, which have been validated for only injection of real power towards grid. However, recently new regulation has been imposed by all international power regulatory agency is that these PV inverters integrated with grid should have the capability of handling flow of a certain quantity of reactive power. By considering this point, a noble topology of transformer-less inverter has been developed for grid integrated PV system. Unlike previous topologies during reactive power injection, the new topology does not face reverse recovery issues, which helps to enhance the efficiency of the proposed inverter by exploiting MOSFET switches. Moreover, leakage current becomes low by keeping the common mode (CM) voltage at input DC voltage's midpoint.",

    "abstract": "Power transformer has an important role in a transmission system. One factor that can reduce efficiency in the transmission system is transmission losses. Efficiency can be increased by reducing losses in the power transformer. The biggest influence determining the losses on the transformer is the material characteristic used by the transformer itself. To get maximum efficiency, it is necessary to optimize the materials on the transformer to get the lowest losses. The study is conducted by measuring core losses and copper losses on the 60 MVA 150/20 kV power transformer with the specified specifications. Furthermore, the transformer materials are changed into several types and the losses calculations are done. The calculation results are compared to get the most effective material. The results show that in the calculation of core losses, the core material type with the lowest core loss value is NK E-core of 0,49 Watt/kg. While in the calculation of copper losses, the winding material type with the lowest loss value is Continuously Transposed Conductor.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian gender recognition plays an important role in smart city. To effectively improve the pedestrian gender recognition performance, a new method, called cascading scene and viewpoint feature learning (CSVFL), is proposed in this article. The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used pedestrian attribute data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CSVFL approach outperforms multiple recently reported pedestrian gender recognition methods.",

    "abstract": "Applications related to smart cities require virtual cities in the experimental development stage. To build a virtual city that are close to a real city, a large number of various types of human models need to be created. To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape–pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.",

In addition, we adopt simulation tools and generative adversarial networks to train the trajectory prediction model so that the private vehicle trajectory dataset conforming to social rules (e.g., collisionless) is generated. Finally, we construct from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives to verify dataset generation methods proposed in this paper. The results show that the generated data not only has high accuracy and is valuable but can provide strong data support for the Internet of Vehicles and transportation research work.",

    "abstract": "Making accurate traffic forecasting is of great importance in smart city-related researches. However, as the traffic features like traffic speed have a complex spatial-temporal characteristics, how to build an accurate traffic prediction model is still an open challenge. In this work, we propose TSTNet, a Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) spatial-temporal traffic prediction model. TSTNet adopts Graph Attention Network (GAT), which can learn the spatial feature aggregation, to build spatial dependency. For temporal dependency, TSTNet applies a Seq2Seq Transformer structure to establish temporal dependency. As a GAT layer’s operation only aggregate the attribute information for neighbor nodes, it does not involve any spatial positional information. Similarly, if we apply the Transformer model on sequence learning tasks, the Transformer model also does not involve any temporal positional information as it does not know the exact time slot of different inputs. To solve the above problems, TSTNet implements a spatial-temporal embedding method to obtain the spatial-temporal positional representation for each input data. We evaluate TSTNet on traffic speed prediction tasks with other baselines upon two real-world datasets, the results show that TSTNet outperforms all the baseline models.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the world is in a period of urbanization that will accelerate the processes of land-use cover and ecological change. Thus, establishing a land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) prediction and simulation model is of great significance for understanding the process of urban change and assessing its ecological impact. In previous studies, LUCC prediction models have been mainly based on cellular automata structures that calculate a future state pixel by pixel through transition rules. Because these transition rules are usually based on the global state and each pixel is calculated according to these fixed rules, the results of these methods have room for improvement in terms of generating details and heterogeneity. In this article, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based LUCC prediction model using multiscale local spatial information is proposed. The model is based on a pix2pix GAN and an attention structure that predicts future land use through multiscale local spatial information. To validate our model, Shenzhen, a region that is experiencing rapid urbanization, was chosen as the source of the experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy in both short-time interval and long-time interval scenarios. In addition, the results of the proposed method were also closest to the ground truth from the perspective of the landscape pattern.",

Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.",

The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems’ potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output—future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution—which is an inherently much more difficult problem.",

The algorithm takes the reference color style images and the images to be corrected in the same area and different phases as the training set and adopts the consistency adversarial network with the U-shaped attention mechanism to train the color consistency model.

This field has been revolutionized by deep learning over the past five years, where during this time, two-stage approaches to object detection have given way to simpler, more efficient, one-stage models. Mean average precision (mAP) on benchmark problems such as the COCO Object Detection dataset has improved almost 4X over the course of five years from 15% (Fast RCNN, a two-stage approach) to 55% (EfficientDet7x, a one-stage approach). This tutorial looks under the hood of state-of-the-art object detection systems, such as two-stage, one-stage, and also more recent approaches based upon transformers.

    "introduction": "The main focus of object detection, one of the most challenging problems in computer vision (CV), is to predict a set of bounding boxes and category labels for each object of interest in an image or in a point cloud. As such, object detection has a variety of exciting downstream applications such as self-driving cars, checkout-less shopping, smart cities, cancer detection, and more. This field has been revolutionized by deep learning over the past five years, where during this time, two-stage approaches to object detection have given way to simpler, more efficient, one-stage models. Mean average precision (mAP) on benchmark problems such as the COCO Object Detection dataset has improved almost 4X over the course of five years from 15% (Fast RCNN, a two-stage approach) to 55% (EfficientDet7x, a one-stage approach). This tutorial looks under the hood of state-of-the-art object detection systems, such as two-stage, one-stage, and also more recent approaches based upon transformers. It builds out some of their associated detection pipelines in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow. While the primary focus is on object detection in digital images from cameras and videos, this tutorial will also introduce object detection in 3D point clouds.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is critical in the Internet of Things (IoT) systems due to its wide applications for building smart cities, such as quality control in manufacturing, intrusion detection in system security, fault detection in system monitoring. Many existing schemes are problem specific and supervised approaches, which require domain knowledge and tremendous data labeling efforts. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised anomaly detection on multidimensional time series data in IoT systems, and develops a GRU-based Gaussian Mixture VAE scheme, called GGM-VAE. In particular, we employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to discover the correlations among time series data, and use Gaussian Mixture priors in the latent space to characterize the multimodal data. Several previous works assume simple distributions for Gaussian Mixture priors, resulting in insufficient ability to fully capture the data patterns. To overcome this issue, we design a model selection mechanism during the training process under the guidance of Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) to find the model which can well estimate the distribution in the Gaussian Mixture latent space. We conduct extensive simulations on four datasets and observe that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection schemes and achieves up to 47.88% improvement in F1 scores on average.",

The study of location semantics has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields due to its wide applications such as location retrieval, location recommendation, data preprocessing and so on. Established inference approaches tend to manually discover the spatiotemporal pattern of unique location as features for training classifiers. However, extracting valuable spatiotemporal patterns or features is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel location semantic inference with graph convolutional networks (SI-GCN). We introduce node2vec and variational autoencoder to learn spatial and temporal features of location, respectively. Furthermore, we leverage graph convolutional networks to capture high order relations in user's check-in activity with building a user-location bipartite network. And leveraging self-attention mechanism is allowed to distinguish contributions of the different nodes.

Owing to the non-stationary nature of road traffic, forecasting accuracy is fundamentally limited by the lack of contextual information. To address this issue, we propose the Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (H-STGCN), which is able to \"deduce\" future travel time by exploiting the data of upcoming traffic volume. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to acquire the upcoming traffic volume from an online navigation engine. Taking advantage of the piecewise-linear flow-density relationship, a novel transformer structure converts the upcoming volume into its equivalent in travel time. We combine this signal with the commonly-utilized travel-time signal, and then apply graph convolution to capture the spatial dependency. Particularly, we construct a compound adjacency matrix which reflects the innate traffic proximity. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "The concept of smart city strives for greener technology to reduce carbon emission to ameliorate the global warming. Following this footprint, the transportation sector is experiencing a paradigm shift and the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has prodigious plausibility in reducing carbon emission. However, the anticipated EV penetration is hindered by several challenges, among them are their shorter driving range, slower charging rate and the lack of ubiquitous availability of charging locations, which collectively contribute to range anxieties for EVs' drivers. Meanwhile, the expected immense EV load onto the power distribution network may degrade the voltage stability. To reduce the range anxiety, we present a two-stage solution to provision and dimension a DC fast charging station (CS) network for the anticipated energy demand and that minimizes the deployment cost while ensuring a certain quality of experience for charging e.g., acceptable waiting time and shorter travel distance to charge. This solution also maintains the voltage stability by considering the distribution grid capacity, determining transformers' rating to support peak demand of EV charging and adding a minimum number of voltage regulators based on the impact over the power distribution network. We propose, evaluate and compare two CS network expansion models to determine a cost-effective and adaptive CSs provisioning solution that can efficiently expand the CS network to accommodate future EV charging and conventional load demands. We also propose two heuristic methods and compare our solution with them. Finally, a custom built Python-based discrete event simulator is developed to test our outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Urban data is a imperative resource for urban computing, which can promote the establishment of urban knowledge, the collection of urban information and the construction of smart cities. Seen that the urban data collected through hardware sensors and crowdsourcing has the limitations of uneven information distribution, poor data comprehensiveness and high resource costs, we turn to the Internet resources of real-time updates and extensive information coverage. Therefore, we propose an approach to Sensing Urban text Data from Internet Resources (SUDIR). We put forward innovative work on two key issues: Urban data recognition for Chinese context and urban data sensing for multi-source web resources. On one hand, we design a Chinese urban data recognition model based on Whole Word Masking for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT-WWM) embedding model and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory with a Conditional Random Field (BLSTM-CRF) sequence labeling model. We introduce Chinese Word Segmentaion (CWS) concept in BERT embedding model to make the text embedding effect better represent semantic information on Chinese context. BLSTM-CRF model based on deep learning is used to achieve high-quality coding and prediction. On the other hand, we propose a method of Extracting Urban text data based on Web page features and Clustering operation (EUWC). EUWC is used to correct the false negative samples labeled by BERT-WWM+BLSTM-CRF recognition model and enable SUDIR to sense more accurate and comprehensive city data from multi-source web resources. The experimental results show that our work outperforms the other baseline methods, and it also proves that SUDIR using Internet resources and deep learning technology has the advantages of low-cost, high-quality urban data sensing.",

On the other hand, we propose a method of Extracting Urban text data based on Web page features and Clustering operation (EUWC). EUWC is used to correct the false negative samples labeled by BERT-WWM+BLSTM-CRF recognition model and enable SUDIR to sense more accurate and comprehensive city data from multi-source web resources. The experimental results show that our work outperforms the other baseline methods, and it also proves that SUDIR using Internet resources and deep learning technology has the advantages of low-cost, high-quality urban data sensing.",
    "introduction": "Urban data is a imperative resource for urban computing, which can promote the establishment of urban knowledge, the collection of urban information and the construction of smart cities. Seen that the urban data collected through hardware sensors and crowdsourcing has the limitations of uneven information distribution, poor data comprehensiveness and high resource costs, we turn to the Internet resources of real-time updates and extensive information coverage.",

    "abstract": "Predicting urban traffic is of great importance to smart city systems and public security; however, it is a very challenging task because of several dynamic and complex factors, such as patterns of urban geographical location, weather, seasons, and holidays. To tackle these challenges, we are stimulated by the deep-learning method proposed to unlock the power of knowledge from urban computing and proposed a deep-learning model based on neural network, entitled Capsules TCN Network, to predict the traffic flow in local areas of the city at once. Capsules TCN Network employs a Capsules Network and Temporal Convolutional Network as the basic unit to learn the spatial dependence, time dependence, and external factors of traffic flow prediction. In specific, we consider some particular scenarios that require accurate traffic flow prediction (e.g., smart transportation, business circle analysis, and traffic flow assessment) and propose a GAN-based superresolution reconstruction model. Extensive experiments were conducted based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of Capsules TCN Network beyond several state-of-the-art methods. Compared with HA, ARIMA, RNN, and LSTM classic methods, respectively, the method proposed in the paper achieved better results in the experimental verification.",

    "abstract": "Rail transport has always been one of the greatest economic boosters of several world nations, allowing the freight and passenger transport. In addition, it is the most secure and economic land transportation mode. From the energetic perspective, the electric locomotives emerge as one of the most efficient land transportation mode, as well as allow a more sustainable development. However, when an electric locomotive is connected to the three-phase power grid, power quality (PQ) deterioration arise, leading to the distortion and unbalance of the three-phase power grid currents and voltages which imply higher operational costs, raising economic and functional issues. In order to overcome the PQ deterioration phenomena, several solutions based power electronics technology have been studied and developed. These solutions vary in terms of control, functionality, implementation costs and complexity. One of the existing solutions is a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), which compensates the three-phase currents imbalance and harmonics. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the electrified railway systems is carried out, identifying the electric PQ phenomena which may appear due to the non-linear dynamic traction loads. Following this topic, a computational simulation of the STATCOM is presented, making analysis of its behavior regarding the PQ improvement in electrified railway systems.

    "abstract": "Electrification of the transportation sector can play a vital role in reshaping smart cities. With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively. It is also realized that the integration of PV improves voltage profile and reduces the negative impact of EV load.

The objective of this research is to forecast how the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) will happen in India and the crucial elements that would influence adoption. The research outcomes are expected to help policy makers to optimally phase investments and incentives earmarked for public charging infrastructure. ‘Bass diffusion model’ has been used as the base for preparing a system dynamics model using Vensim software to forecast the diffusion of EV’s from 2017 to 2030. Consumer willingness to purchase EV’s has been elicited through a survey conducted among 50 respondents, who drive 4-wheelers. Adoption has been modeled considering the effect of 4 parameters on consumer willingness to purchase EV, namely- price differential between EV’s and ICE vehicles, range, recharge time and charging infrastructure density. The model output indicates an S-shaped diffusion curve with saturation near the 50th month. Out of the four parameters, adoption is found to be highly sensitive to charging infrastructure density. The paper concludes that there is a high scope of optimizing government investment in charging infrastructure which would require a detailed view of technical, policy and market related aspects.",

Multiple operational and environmental factors such as overloading, moisture, heat, progressive ageing, and so on lead to deterioration of insulation (winding and bushing), oil quality and so on result in decreasing PT operational efficiency and lifespan. It is crucial to assess the health condition of such PTs continuously to realize improved efficiency, early fault detection & diagnostics, prediction of maintenance requirements, and reinvestment strategy.

This trend will saturate soon especially due to the unintended thermal noise that is dissipated, as the density of transistors on the chips increase and as the corresponding electronics approach their physical limits. There is a need to implement new processing and computing techniques [2] with more compact size, lower power consumption and enhanced performance.

    "introduction": "There has been an exponential growth in the microelectronics industry over the last 70 years with a consistent miniaturization of transistors' size and increase in the speed and on-chip transistors density with reasonable power consumption, as seen in Figure 1 [1]. This trend will saturate soon especially due to the unintended thermal noise that is dissipated, as the density of transistors on the chips increase and as the corresponding electronics approach their physical limits. There is a need to implement new processing and computing techniques [2] with more compact size, lower power consumption and enhanced performance. Neuromorphic computing mimics the parallel processing of the mammalian brain and the quantum decoherence within the neurons, and seems to be promising for future applications and needs high speed electronics [3].

This paper aims to discover a mapping between live and dead phytoplankton. We propose PhytoGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network for the unpaired dead-tolive phytoplankton translation. We design a new PCALoss by extracting the principal component of the image to enhance the contour of the generated image. The addition of PCALoss can significantly improve the integrity of images. The experiments are carried out on the existing phytoplankton dataset. A series of experiments are discussed in the paper to demonstrate the performance of the domain transformation and the proposed loss functions. The experimental results indicate that PhytoGAN can produce more integral images of phytoplankton while completing the domain transformation compared with the existing methods.",

Accordingly, to address these problems, we propose several procedures for improving the training of Primal Wasserstein GANs. We test the effectiveness of our proposed procedures on MNIST, CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedroom and ImageNet-Dog category datasets, and the extensive experimental results confirm that our method is capable of generating high-quality images and obtaining high inception score.

    "abstract": "Since the rate at which new content is uploaded to the Internet has reached unprecedented marks, knowing the popularity of online content, especially video, is of importance for network management, recommendation schemes, service design, advertising planning, and so on. Despite the fact that various models have been developed, few of them address the short-term popularity prediction. Toward this goal, we exploit the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer, a state-of-the-art model in neural machine translation, to forecast the values of multiple time series in the near future. Specifically, we propose an attention-based non-recursive neural network, a novel model that entirely dispenses with recurrence and convolutions, for time series prediction. Since our model is the combination of the input attention mechanism in the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) and the self-attention of Transformer, it is able to adaptively select the most relevant input sequences as well as capture the long-term dependencies across previous time steps to make the prediction. The experiments show the root mean square errors (RMSEs) achieved by our model are only 6.06 and 3.60 when testing on the NASDAQ 100 dataset and the views count of the top most popular videos on Youtube respectively, while the RMSEs of DA-RNN are 8.52 and 12.31.
