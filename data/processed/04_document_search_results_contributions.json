    "Purpose: This paper proposes a solution to address matching challenges, such as incomplete descriptions, reversed word order, and the diverse descriptions often found in Chinese addresses. Method: Leveraging the hierarchical structure of Chinese addresses, this study introduces the interactive address matching graph attention model (IAMGAM). In the IAMGAM, an attention-based feature interaction method (AFIM) is employed. To reflect the hierarchical nature of address elements, a directed graph is used to model the address data, and the model is trained and tested using a graph attention mechanism. Results: Experiments demonstrate that the IAMGAM achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 99.61%. Compared with the existing address matching methods, the IAMGAM improves the accuracy by 0.66% to 2.57%, and the F1-score by 0.68% to 2.55%, outperforming baseline models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component within the model. Furthermore, when fine-tuned using ChatGLM2-6B, the results show that the IAMGAM still outperforms ChatGLM2-6B. Conclusion: IAMGAM demonstrates excellent performance in Chinese address matching tasks, and the Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods, such as ChatGLM2-6B, show great potential for future development in this area.",

    "In this paper, we propose a Skip connection driven Two-stream property fusion Variational AutoEncoder (STVAE) for cross-region WWTP semantic segmentation. Our motivation is to increase the generalization capability of STVAE by capturing and fusing generative probabilistic features, inherent region properties and multi-scale properties. Specifically, STVAE captures the generative probabilistic features by constructing an attention-driven variational encoder. These features make STVAE more adaptable to the cross-domain changes, improving the segmentation robustness and performance. This attention-driven structure contributes to learning local details and limiting the effect of weak semantic information. Furthermore, a two-stream parallel decoder is considered to adapt distributions from different perspectives. The inherent region properties are introduced in this decoder to highlight the spatial consistency of the results. The unsupervised inherent region information and multi-scale features, which are extracted by this decoder, are fused through an entropy-wise mechanism. Additionally, a unique adversarial strategy is utilized to align the distributions of different domains. Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and Microsoft Bing Maps Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images, multiple experiments conducted on three tasks illustrate the effectiveness of STVAE compared with several state-of-the-art techniques qualitatively and quantitatively. STVAE effectively expands its application scope.",

    "The study compares these findings with insights from an expert survey that included 52 experts. The study identifies concurrence on the components that comprise a \u201cDigital Twin\u201d from a practical perspective across various domains, contrasting them with those that do not, to identify deviations. We investigate the evolution of digital twin definitions over time and across different scales, including manufacturing, building, and urban/geospatial perspectives. We extracted the main components of Digital Twins using Text Frequency Analysis and N-gram analysis. Subsequently, we identified components that appeared in the literature and conducted a Chi-square test to assess the significance of each component in different domains. Our analysis identified key components of digital twins and revealed significant variations in definitions based on application domains, such as manufacturing, building, and urban contexts. The analysis of DT components reveal two major groups of DT types: High-Performance Real-Time (HPRT) DTs, and Long-Term Decision Support (LTDS) DTs. Contrary to common assumptions, we found that components such as simulation, AI/ML, real-time capabilities, and bi-directional data flow are not yet fully mature in the digital twins of the built environment. We derived two definitions for the Building/Architecture DT and the City/Urban DTs. Both definitions have a must-have components (such as spatial and temporal data updates) and good-to-have components such as prediction, AI, bi-directional data flow, and Real-time data exchange. One of the key findings is that the definition of digital twins has not yet reached its equilibrium phase, highlighting the need for ongoing revisions as technologies emerge or existing ones become obsolete. To address this, we introduce a novel, reproducible methodology that enables researchers to refine and adapt the current definitions in response to technological advancements or deprecations.",
    "Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end POI extraction framework based on digital city is proposed. It is built of digital models, textures, tiles and other digital assets collected by aircraft.

    "In this manuscript, Strengthening Security in IoT-Based Smart Cities utilizing Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks for Attack Detection and Secure Data Transmission (IoT-SC-CCGAN-ADSDT) is proposed. Here, input information is gathered from NSL-KDD. The NSL-KDD input is pre-processed. Then, the important features of the pre-processed data are selected by using Wild horse optimizer (WHO). After feature selection, the chosen features are provided to cycle-consistent generative adversarial network classifier for classifying the attack and normal data.

    "In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban attractiveness, using over 1800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the GPT-4 model, we assessed these images through three criteria-based prompts. Simultaneously, 24 participants, categorised into residents and non-residents, were asked to rate the images. To gain insights into the non-transparent decision-making processes of GPT-4, we employed semantic segmentation to explore how the model uses different image features. Our results demonstrated a strong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic disparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban areas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these areas less attractive. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated urban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower attractiveness scores than participant ratings. The semantic segmentation analysis revealed that GPT-4's ratings were primarily influenced by physical features like vegetation, buildings, and sidewalk. While there was general agreement between AI and human assessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual nuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and features of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models like GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the attractiveness of different areas efficiently. However, caution is necessary, while we used an off-the-shelf model, it is crucial to develop models specifically trained to understand the local context. Although AI models provide valuable insights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of urban attractiveness.",
    "We propose the multi-branch generative prior integration network (MBGPIN) to address these limitations.

Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as UC Merced, NWPU-RESISC45, and RSSCN7 demonstrate that the MBGPIN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including large-scale super-resolution models. The MBGPIN delivers a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) scores while preserving high-frequency details and complex textures. The model also achieves significant computational efficiency, with reduced floating point operations (FLOPs) and faster inference times, making it scalable for real-world applications.",

    "We propose crash likelihood prediction as an effective strategy to proactively prevent intersection crashes. So far, no reliable models have been developed for intersections that effectively account for the variation in crash types and the cyclical nature of Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) and traffic flow. Moreover, the limited research available has primarily relied on sampling techniques to address data imbalance, without exploring alternative solutions. We develop an anomaly detection framework by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to predict the likelihood of cycle-level crashes at intersections. The model is built using high-resolution event data extracted from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM), including SPaT and traffic flow insights from 11 intersections in Seminole County, Florida. Our framework demonstrates a sensitivity of 76% in predicting crash events using highly imbalanced crash data along with real-world SPaT and traffic data, highlighting its potential for deployment at smart intersections. Overall, the results provide a roadmap for city-wide implementation at smart intersections, with the potential for multiple real-time solutions for impending crashes. These include adjustments in signal timing, driver warnings using various means, and more efficient emergency response, all with major implications for creating more livable and safe cities.",

    "We introduce a system that learns to sculpt 3D models of massive urban environments. The majority of humans live their lives in urban environments, using detailed virtual models for applications as diverse as virtual worlds, special effects, and urban planning. Generating such 3D models from exemplars manually is time-consuming, while 3D deep learning approaches have high memory costs. In this paper, we present a technique for training 2D neural networks to repeatedly sculpt a plane into a large-scale 3D urban environment. An initial coarse depth map is created by a GAN model, from which we refine 3D normal and depth using an image translation network regularized by a linear system. The networks are trained using real-world data to allow generative synthesis of meshes at scale. We exploit sculpting from multiple viewpoints to generate a highly detailed, concave, and water-tight 3D mesh. We show cityscapes at scales of 100\u00d71600 meters with more than 2 million triangles, and demonstrate that our results are objectively and subjectively similar to our exemplars.",
    "Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study.

Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs.",

    "This study examines the effect of synthetic data generation for balancing class distributions on the performance of classification algorithms in smart city network systems. Contrary to the assumption that data balancing improves classification performance, the analysis reveals a more complex impact. Using three publicly available network traffic benchmark datasets and four different balancing techniques, the study evaluates the performance of five classifiers on 65 classification tasks. The findings indicate that, for smaller datasets, classifiers that achieved the highest accuracy on unbalanced data did not benefit from synthetic data generation for minority classes. Although neural network-based classifiers showed improved performance with balanced data, these improvements came at the cost of lower overall classification scores. For larger datasets, balancing through random oversampling of minority classes and undersampling of majority classes helped improve classification. However, these improvements were limited to precision, with no significant gains in recall. The study offers valuable insights into using synthetic data for intrusion detection, emphasizing the challenges of intricate dependencies in network traffic data for generative models. The results align with previous research showing mixed effects of data balancing on classifier performance, contributing to a broader understanding of the limited efficacy of synthetic data in real-world network contexts. This experimental study highlights the need for a systematic benchmarking framework for synthetic data research, ensuring consistency in data balancing and classification processes. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, emphasizing the critical role of data in developing resilient intrusion detection systems.",

    "Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-LSTM, BERT and GPT-4 etc. Therefore, the proposed MLR model with a customized loss function could be moderately effective for patent classification within a specific technology theme, could have implications for patent classification and the TF resolution of patents, and could further enrich methodologies for patent mining and informetrics based on artificial intelligence (AI).",

    "[Progress] On the basis of elaborating the connotation of spatial clustering patterns of features, this paper summarizes two types of methods for spatial clustering pattern discovery, including rule-oriented pattern extraction and data-driven pattern recognition. The rule-oriented pattern extraction methods rely on expert knowledge to summarize pattern characteristics. They express, constrain and guide the pattern discovery process with formal explicit rules, and extract the features of the specified spatial clustering patterns from the spatial data set. The data-driven pattern recognition methods draw knowledge from both 'experts' and 'data'. They learn the pattern characteristics of features from multiple scales and perspectives through a large number of samples automatically under the guidance of expert knowledge, and perform category prediction on a set of features in order to identify the spatial clustering patterns of the features. Subsequently, the spatial clustering pattern discovery of three types of typical features, namely buildings, roads and water systems, is reviewed. The data-driven approach represented by graph deep learning is usually superior to the rule-oriented pattern extraction approach in terms of pattern discovery accuracy due to its powerful pattern learning capability. In terms of the overall trend, spatial clustering pattern discovery of features is shifting from traditional methods to close integration with deep learning methods.

    "This study utilized Sentinel-1 satellite data, acquired between September 2018 and May 2023, and applied the Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique to monitor surface deformation in Nanchang\u2019s urban area. The findings revealed that surface deformation rates in the study area range from \u221210 mm/a to 6 mm/a, with the majority of regions remaining relatively stable. Approximately 99.9% of the monitored points exhibited deformation rates within \u22125 mm/a to 5 mm/a. However, four significant subsidence zones were identified along the Gan River and its downstream regions, with a maximum subsidence rate reaching 9.7 mm/a. Historical satellite imagery comparisons indicated that certain subsidence areas are potentially associated with construction activities. Further analysis integrating subsidence data, monthly precipitation, and groundwater depth revealed a negative correlation between surface deformation in Region A and rainfall, with subsidence trends aligning with groundwater level fluctuations. However, such a correlation was not evident in the other three regions. Additionally, water level data from the Xingzi Station of Poyang Lake showed that only Region A\u2019s subsidence trend closely corresponds with water level variations. We conducted a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of soil types in Nanchang and found that the soil types in areas of surface deformation are primarily Semi-hydromorphic Soils and Anthropogenic Soils. These soils exhibit high compressibility, making them prone to compaction and significantly influencing surface deformation. This study concludes that localized surface deformation in Nanchang is primarily driven by urban construction activities and the compaction of artificial fill soils, while precipitation also has an impact in certain areas.",

    "This paper explores some ways that far-right worldviews are digitally encoded and strategically-assembled in and through built environments. The paper argues that an understanding of far-right spatiality will be limited without a more inter-scalar, relational and material framing of the various components of far-right world-building. Assemblage ontologies, seen through comparative cases, therefore hold value in making sense of the far-right today. Explorations of how digital media and the far-right are entangled with and co-producing built environments, are thus vital. As ideologies and philosophies (e.g., nationalism or conspiracism) travel across networked medias, complex hybridizations become infrastructurally-fixed-in-place. These affixations produce, and are produced by, geographical communities (e.g., urban developments). Far-right material infrastructures thereby extend from, and into, the digital, mediated by both human and nonhuman processes (such as generative AI), thus becoming co-constitutive elements of place, via land ownership, buildings, aesthetics, social encounters and practices, urban planning processes, and electoral politics; e.g., the assembled spatialities of everyday life. The paper juxtaposes two international cases, drawn from ethnography and critical discourse/visual analyses. The first is the territorialisation of circulating notions of American hyper-patriotic nationalism in the suburban South via urban developments and recreational spaces. The second case explores how far-right representations of conspiracism and debates around urban traditionalism versus modernity, are contested online and offline in Dresden, Saxony. Both cases point to the powerful entanglements of far-right ideology, digital media, and place. Conceptually, the paper juxtaposes phenomenological notions of far-right space/place with ideas of \u2018strategic assemblage\u2019 and online/offline \u2018code space\u2019, as ontological lenses to interrogate the relationships between far-right online worlds and the material configurations of physical infrastructures and materials which have troubling implications for everyday environments and democratic life.",

    "This approach is highly suitable for computer processing and allows for the rapid rendering of entire building models and cities, especially when the buildings are not highly diverse, thus fully leveraging the strengths of procedural modeling. The first hypothesis is that buildings in the real world are mostly different and they should still be able to be displayed through procedural modeling procedures, and the second hypothesis is that this can be achieved in several ways. The first hypothesis suggests that real-world buildings, despite their diversity, can still be effectively represented through procedural modeling. The second hypothesis explores various methods to achieve this representation. The first approach involves recognizing the basic characteristics of a building from photographs and creating a model using machine learning. The second approach utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate detailed building models based on comprehensive input data. A script is generated for each building, making reverse procedural modeling in combination with AI an intriguing field of study, which is explored in this research. To validate this method, we compare AI-generated building models with manually derived models created through traditional procedural modeling techniques. The research demonstrates that integrating AI and machine learning techniques with procedural modeling significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of generating 3D building models. Specifically, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-to-geometry translation, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture generation, showed promising results in creating detailed and realistic 3D structures. This research is significant as it introduces a novel methodology that bridges the gap between traditional procedural modeling and modern AI-driven techniques. It offers a robust solution for automated 3D building modeling, potentially revolutionizing the fields of urban planning and architectural design by enabling more efficient and accurate digital representations of complex building geometries.",

    "In this study, we introduce a novel probabilistic model \u2014 the conditional diffusion framework with spatio-temporal estimator (CDSTE) \u2014 to tackle the TSES problem. When dealing with TSES, deterministic models can only produce point value estimates, which may substantially deviate from the actual traffic states of sensor-free locations. To mitigate this, the proposed CDSTE integrates the conditional diffusion framework with cutting-edge spatio-temporal networks to extract the underlying dependencies in traffic states between sensor-free and sensor-equipped nodes. This integration enables reliable probabilistic traffic state estimations for sensor-free locations, which can be used to quantify the variability of estimations in TSES to support flexible and robust decision-making processes for traffic management and control. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CDSTE for TSES over five widely-used baseline models.",
    "In this paper, we target a new task called function-aware urban layout regeneration, and propose UrbanEvolver, a function-aware deep generative model for the task. Given a target region to be regenerated, our model outputs a regenerated urban layout (i.e., roads and buildings) for the target region by considering the function (i.e., land use type) of the target region and its surrounding context (i.e., the functions and urban layouts of the surrounding regions). UrbanEvolver first extracts implicit regeneration rules from the target function and the surrounding context by encoding them separately in different scales through the function-layout adaptive (FA) blocks, and then constrains the regenerated urban layout based on the learned regeneration rules. To enforce the regenerated layout to be valid and to follow the road structure, we design a set of losses covering both pixel-level and geometry-level constraints. To train our model, we collect a large-scale urban layout dataset covering more than 147 K regions under 1300 km2 with rich annotations, including functions, region shapes, urban road layouts, and urban building layouts. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our model outperforms the baseline methods in generating practical and function-aware urban layouts based on the given target function and surrounding context.",
    "This article discusses an application for classifying urban spaces using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A seed dataset was initially generated composed of 630 photographs of urban spaces from the Adobe Stock repository. This dataset was topped up with images produced by two generative artificial intelligence (AI) engines, namely, Deep Dream Generator and Midjourney, making two additional augmented datasets, each composed of 2200 images. The training process was carried out using four well-known CNNs, namely, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet-v2. The results show an increase of roughly 30% in the predicting capabilities in both augmented datasets when compared to the seed dataset. Furthermore, performance metrics are generally higher when using ResNet-18 which may suggest that this CNN architecture is more applicable to urban classification projects. Finally, although both generative AI engines have similar performance, Midjourney seems to slightly outperform Deep Dream Generator as a data augmentation engine for urban spaces.",

The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information.

Preprocessing the forest fire dataset is the initial step in order to improve its relevance and quality.

To produce this image translation from sketch to H-HD face, two techniques are presented in this article, namely cycle generative adversarial network (CGAN) and multistage cycle generative adversarial network (MS-CGAN). MS-CGAN has multiple layers as stages and produces minimum cycle consistency and generative adversarial losses. CGAN uses paired data for training whereas MS-CGAN uses unpaired data.

    "This research paper proposes a novel approach to generating building and residential plans using VAE and GANs. The project started with a VAE with Dall-e, which imposed more constraints on the output image. However, this led to pixelated images that were difficult to interpret. To overcome this, GANs were used, which required fewer constraints to produce more explicit output images. In GANs, two networks are trained simultaneously, a generator network that produces new samples and a discriminator network that evaluates the quality of the generated samples. Through adversarial training, the generator network learns to produce images that resemble the actual samples. The proposed GAN approach can overpower traditional residential plan design methods, producing accurate and high-resolution plans that are easier to interpret. However, using GANs is challenging, with instability in the training process leading to mode collapse or gradient vanishing. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the potential of deep learning-based methods for generating building or residential plans.

    "Method: In light of this, we propose a structure similarity virtual map generation network (SVGNet) to address the task of optical and SAR image matching. The core innovation of this paper is that we take inspiration from the concept of image generation, to handle the predicament of image matching between different modalities. Firstly, we introduce the Attention U-Net as a generator to decouple and characterize optical images. And then, SAR images are consistently converted into optical images with similar textures and structures. At the same time, using the structural similarity (SSIM) to constrain structural spatial information to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, a conditional generative adversarial network is employed to further guide the image generation process. By combining synthesized SAR images and their corresponding optical images in a dual channel, we can enhance prior information. This combined data is then fed into the discriminator to determine whether the images are true or false, guiding the generator to optimize feature learning. Finally, we employ least squares loss (LSGAN) to stabilize the training of the generative adversarial network. Results and Discussion: Experiments have demonstrated that the SVGNet proposed in this paper is capable of effectively reducing modal differences, and it increases the matching success rate. Compared to direct image matching, using image generation ideas results in a matching accuracy improvement of more than twice.",

Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and feature fusion are integrated into the asymmetric encoder\u2013decoder structure to avoid feature redundancy caused by multi-level cascading operations and enhance the generator network\u2019s ability to extract fine-grained road information at the pixel level. Second, to maintain road connectivity, topologic features are considered in the pixel segmentation process. A linear structural similarity loss ((Formula presented.)) is introduced into the loss function of MS-AGAN, which guides MS-AGAN to generate more accurate segmentation results. Finally, to fairly evaluate the performance of deep models under complex backgrounds, the Bayesian error rate (BER) is introduced into the field of road extraction for the first time. Experiments are conducted via Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images with high vegetation coverage in the Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the public DeepGlobe dataset. The performance of MS-AGAN is compared with a list of advanced models, including RCFSNet, CoANet, UNet, DeepLabV3+, and DiResNet. The final results show that (1) with respect to road extraction performance, the Recall, F1, and IoU values of MS-AGAN on the Daxing dataset are 2.17%, 0.04%, and 2.63% higher than the baselines. On DeepGlobe, the Recall, F1, and IoU of MS-AGAN improve by 1.12%, 0.42%, and 0.25%, respectively. (2) On road connectivity, the Conn index of MS-AGAN from the Daxing dataset is 46.39%, with an improvement of 0.62% over the baselines, and the Conn index of MS-AGAN on DeepGlobe is 70.08%, holding an improvement of 1.73% over CoANet. The quantitative and qualitative analyses both demonstrate the superiority of MS-AGAN in preserving road connectivity. (3) In particular, the BER of MS-AGAN is 20.86% over the Daxing dataset with a 0.22% decrease compared to the best baselines and 11.77% on DeepGlobe with a 0.85% decrease compared to the best baselines. The proposed MS-AGAN provides an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable method for the dynamic updating of road networks via HRSIs.",
    "This study presents the process of developing the AI model, which suggests appropriate land use plans for user-targeted sites and urban density scenarios. We first create an image dataset that embeds land use, floor area ratio (FAR), and building cover ratio (BCR) information in the RGB channel. Then, an algorithm is developed for establishing an optimized training set with 1000 images and methods for validating the obtained results from both quantitative and visual perspectives. We set up a pilot test to generate three urban density scenarios in Sewoon-Sangga district by constructing urban data-encoded image datasets of Seoul.

We rethink the urban planning generative task from a unique functionality perspective, where we summarize planning requirements into different functionality projections for better urban plan generation. To this end, we develop a three-stage generation process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function. The third stage is to leverage multi-attentions to model the zone-zone peer dependencies of the functionality projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

    "However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images. This method has broadened the applications of deep learning in haze removal, particularly highlighting its potential in the fields of autonomous driving and smart cities.",
    "Therefore, this study introduced a deep learning-based design that combines the attention-based generative adversarial network (ABGAN) with the multi-objective interactive honeybee mating optimization (MOIHBMO) approach to create an automated face mask recognition system. A set of 1386 images has been used to create a real-time dataset. This database contains 690 pictures without face masks and 686 images with them. The suggested algorithm ABGAN-MOIHBMO is compared to other traditional methods for detection of face masks, such as DL, AI, and DNN. The performance indicators used are error rate, inference speed, precision, recall, accuracy, and over fitting assessments. The results demonstrate that the proposed ABGAN-MOIHBMO outperforms the existing methodologies. It provides 96% of precision, 86% of recall, 93% for the f1 score, which are higher/better than the other, traditional methods. The error rate in ABGAN-MOIHBMO is a low 1.1%, which is lower other approaches.

    "This work predicts future adoptions of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems throughout an entire city using open-source geographic information system (GIS) data. The approach combines census income and building zoning data into a single geographic district map where adoptions are likely to be consistent from year to year. Existing PV system locations for each year are input into a data-driven model for each of the combined income and building type districts to predict future PV installations. In this work, two algorithms were tested as part of the methodology: linear least-squares regression and the Bass Diffusion model. Using a linear regression algorithm, in this paper's test city (Santa Fe, New Mexico, U.S.A), the percentage of loads with PV was predicted to increase from 5.2% in 2020 to 18% in 2050. In the same test city, the Bass Diffusion model predicted and increase in PV to be about 27% of the all the buildings by 2050.

    "In this paper, we exploit the idea of a training model based on the \u201cCloze Test\u201d strategy in natural language processing (NLP) and introduce a novel unsupervised learning framework to encode both motion and appearance information at an object level. Specifically, to store the normal modes of video activity reconstructions, we first design an optical stream memory network with skip connections. Secondly, we build a space\u2013time cube (STC) for use as the basic processing unit of the model and erase a patch in the STC to form the frame to be reconstructed. This enables a so-called \u201dincomplete event (IE)\u201d to be completed. On this basis, a conditional autoencoder is utilized to capture the high correspondence between optical flow and STC. The model predicts erased patches in IEs based on the context of the front and back frames. Finally, we employ a generating adversarial network (GAN)-based training method to improve the performance of VAD. By distinguishing the predicted erased optical flow and erased video frame, the anomaly detection results are shown to be more reliable with our proposed method which can help reconstruct the original video in IE. Comparative experiments conducted on the benchmark UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets demonstrate AUROC scores reaching 97.7%, 89.7%, and 75.8%, respectively.",

We propose an extended mutual information (EMI) metric to mine the internal correlation structure among different data features, which enhances the data reconstruction capability of CSCAD. The reconstruction loss and latent standard deviation vector of a sample obtained from reconstruction network can be perceived as two natural anomalous degree measures. An anomaly discriminating network can then be trained using low anomalous degree samples as positive samples, and high anomalous degree samples as negative samples. Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms all the competing baselines.",
    "This study proposes using big data analytics to transform real-time unstructured data from CCTV into information that can be shown on a web dashboard. As a Hadoop-based architectural stack that can serve as the ICT backbone for managing unstructured data efficiently, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores several sorts of data using the Hadoop file storage system, a high-performance integrated virtual environment (HIVE) tables, and non-relational storage. Traditional computer vision algorithms are incapable of processing such massive amounts of visual data collected in real-time. However, the inferiority of traffic data and the quality of unit information are always symmetrical phenomena. As a result, there is a need for big data analytics with machine learning, which entails processing and analyzing vast amounts of visual data, such as photographs or videos, to uncover semantic patterns that may be interpreted. As a result, smart cities require a more accurate traffic flow prediction system. In comparison to other recent methods applied to the dataset, the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy of 98.21%.

Moreover, results indicated that a relatively sufficient amount of unlabeled data compared with labeled data are required to increase the classification accuracy by controlling the amount of labeled and unlabeled data. Finally, we verified that the semi-supervised method returned significantly improved results irrespective of the three classification network structures, displaying the applicability of the method for semi-supervised image classification on remotely-sensed VHR images.",

    "We propose a novel, deep human-instructed urban planner to fill these gaps and implement two practical frameworks. In the preliminary version, we formulate the task into an encoder\u2013decoder paradigm. The encoder is to learn the information distribution of surrounding contexts, human instructions, and land-use configuration. The decoder is to reconstruct the land-use configuration and the associated urban functional zones. Although it has achieved good results, the generation performance is still unstable due to the complex optimization directions of the decoder. Thus, we propose a cascading deep generative adversarial network (GAN) in this paper, inspired by the workflow of urban experts. The first GAN is to build urban functional zones based on human instructions and surrounding contexts. The second GAN will produce the land-use configuration by considering the built urban functional zones. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments and case studies to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our work.",

    "This study established grid groups with different built environment layouts around urban park from the perspective of 3D building characteristics, land cover and road network. Then the correlation relationship between built environment and building energy consumption was examined by using the spatial regressive model, and the positivity and difference of building environment effect on building energy consumption were analyzed and compared emphatically. The results showed that water body and road intersection can weaken the positive effect of impervious surface area (ISA) in compact high-rise building area, and water body can promote the negative effect of form factor (S/V) in sparse high-rise building area. Additionally, we found that the sparse high-rise buildings were conducive to the spread of cold air in the park compared to compact high-rise, which promoted the negative effects of S/V. Therefore, the built environment should be incorporated into urban planning to reduce building energy consumption.",

In particular, we first construct spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data crawled from websites to learn graph representations. We then combine each target area and its surrounding context representations as a tuple, and categorize all tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Next, we develop an adversarial learning framework, in which a generator takes the surrounding context representations as input to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish between positive and negative samples.

    "In order to handle the challenge of removing raindrops, two different strategies are adopted in this research study: The Diffusion model and the Generative adversarial network model. By considering the recent improvements in image deraining methods, this research study proposes a novel technique that makes use of conditional generative adversarial network with adversarial loss, which provides a factor to loss functions and regulates the output for achieving the improved results. In addition, diffusion modelling, a novel patch-based method is used to perform image restoration. Diffusion probabilistic frameworks are used for normalising noise over affected regions. This research study compares and evaluates how well these two techniques perform in eliminating the raindrops from images. This study demonstrates that the diffusion model outperforms the GAN technique in terms of qualitative assessments and visual appearance by conducting a comparative analysis on actual and synthetic data.",
    "In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets show the superiority of our model in various metrics over state-of-the-art models.",
    "In this demonstration paper, we present STM: a new system for securing and management of vehicle trajectory data using a generative model that balances privacy and utility. For instance, traditional methods for taxi-demand prediction pose the risk of privacy breaches from both the data and the model. To address this challenge, we deploy Spatiotemporal-GAN to generate synthetic trajectories that meet privacy regulations such as GDPR. We assess the quality of the generated data by constructing several taxi-demand prediction models. Moreover, we evaluate the privacy risk by implementing trajectory user linking attacks against the generated data and membership inference attacks against the prediction model. Our system is designed with rich interactivity and visualization, enabling the audience to use these modules. Overall, our approach demonstrates the potential of generative models in preserving privacy while maintaining data utility in the context of taxi-demand prediction.",

In experiments, we show that the privacy-preserving trajectory data generated by PPTG can achieve superior performance in terms of privacy protection and data utility against the existing approaches.",
    "The main focus of the work is to improve the smart traffic systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) such as traditional signals and safe driving via tracking the congestion and monitoring traffic slowly. Depending on the circumstances, intersections between roads can sometimes lead to accidents, so this problem is considered part of the research. These limitations can be overcome by using modern sensors that can reduce the traffic signal waiting time and rash driving on the National Highway (NH) road.

    "To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability. Additionally, in terms of algorithm efficiency, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms tested in terms of the number of iterations and speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed planning model in improving the economy and stability of the distribution network.

    "This research proposes an innovative method for correcting banding errors in satellite images based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Small satellites are frequently launched into space to obtain images that can be used in scientific or military research, commercial activities, and urban planning, among other applications. However, its small cameras are more susceptible to radiometric, geometric errors, and other distortions caused by atmospheric interference. The proposed method was compared to the conventional correction technique using experimental data, showing the similar performance (92.64% and 90.05% accuracy, respectively). These experimental results suggest that generative models utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically Deep Learning, are getting closer to achieving automatic correction close to conventional methods. Advantages of the GAN models include automating the task of correcting banding in satellite images, reducing the required time, and facilitating the processing without requiring prior technical knowledge in handling Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Potentially, this technique could represent a valuable tool for satellite image processing, improving the accuracy of the results and making the process more efficient.

    "It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

To overcome this challenge, we propose a machine learning based relaying topology algorithm with a novel backward-pass rate assessment method to present proper learning direction and an iterative balancing time slot allocation algorithm which can utilize a node with sufficient energy as the relay. To validate our proposed scheme, we conducted simulations on our established system model; thus, we confirm that the proposed scheme is stable and superior to conventional schemes.",

    "This study first examines the cutting-edge approaches for trajectory generation, classification, and next-location prediction. Second, we propose a novel privacy-aware approach for predicting next-week trajectories. The approach is based on two modules, a Generative Adversarial Network used for generating synthetic trajectories and a deep learning model for user identification which safeguards privacy. These two modules are combined with a next-week trajectory predictor that uses privacy-aware synthetic data. The experiments on two real-life datasets show that the generator creates trajectories similar to the real ones yet different enough to safeguard privacy. The low user-recognition recognition accuracy of models trained on the generated data demonstrates privacy awareness. Statistical tests confirm no significant difference between the original and the generated trajectories.

    "To address this problem, we propose a method based on improved 3-D morphological analysis for extracting street trees from mobile laser scanner (MLS) point clouds. First, the 3-D semantic point cloud segmentation framework based on deep learning is used for preclassification of the original point cloud to obtain the vegetation point cloud in the scene. Considering the influence of terrain unevenness, the vegetation point cloud is deterraformed and slice point cloud containing tree trunks is obtained through spatial filtering on height. On this basis, a voxel-based region growing method constrained with the changing rate of convex area is used to locate the stree trees. Then we propose a progressive tree crown segmentation method, which first completed the preliminary individual segmentation of the tree crown point cloud based on the voxel-based region growth constrained by the minimum increment rule, and then optimizes the crown edges by 'valley' structure-based clustering. In this article, the proposed method is validated and the accuracy is evaluated using three sets of MLS datasets collected from different scenarios. The experimental results show that the method can effectively identify and localize street trees with different geometries and has a good segmentation effect for street trees with large adhesion between canopies.

Parameterized urban blocks are designed for random sampling and constructing a numerical simulation database. The GAN model was trained to predict pedestrian level wind (PLW), annual cumulative solar radiation (Radiation) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in real-time. The GAN-based surrogate model is combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve real-time optimization of urban morphology. The results show that on the test set, the pix2pix model using a specific encoding method predicts the R2 of 0.70, 0.86 and 0.80 for PLW, Radiation and UTCI, respectively, while the method can speed up 120\u2013240 times compared to the numerical simulation method. The optimization results show that NSGA-II combined with global averaging pooling achieves the best optimization results. When the number of optimized samples exceeds 174, the proposed method has a time advantage over traditional methods for outdoor environment optimization in urban design.",

(2) The coupling coordination degree of ecological environment and urban resilience in the Yangtze River Economic Belt increased steadily, forming a spatial distribution pattern of \u201cstrong in the east and weak in the west\u201d, with cities in the region mainly at the basic coordination level and generally lagging behind in development. (3) Both the ecological environment and urban resilience systems in the Yangtze River Economic Belt have significant self-reinforcing mechanisms, but the reinforcing effect is gradually decreasing, and the two positively promote each other, with urban resilience showing a more obvious promoting effect on the ecological environment.",
    "This paper is the first to introduce the theory of peer effects to explain the interactive behavior of urban environmental regulation (UER). We construct a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model including lagged terms of the dependent variable using panel data of 284 cities in China from 2003 to 2019. The results show that: (1) there are significant peer effects of UER among geographically, economically, and administratively related cities, and the highest peer effects is found among geographically adjacent cities. (2) Cities with higher intensity of environmental regulation have larger peer effects and are more likely to be imitated. (3) The internal learning effect of cities weakens the peer effects of UER, while the external learning effect and competition mechanism strengthen it. Exogenous shocks such as the new environmental regulation standard policy, innovation-oriented city pilot work, and the opening of high-speed rail all have a significant impact on the peer effects of UER. The study suggests the central government guides the positive interaction of local governments\u2019 environmental regulations to promote regional pollution control.",

    "Contrary to current assumptions on the functional mix of small and medium-sized towns, our findings showed that more than half of the settlements across the study area accommodated three or more functions. Since the share of residential buildings and functional mix strongly influenced land take, further research is needed to understand their implications on sustainable urban planning. Shrinking towns in Lower Saxony continue to present multidimensional challenges and emphasize the need for transforming local planning cultures and institutional frameworks to sustainably manage and repurpose these potentially vacant areas.",
    "In this paper, we address the crowdsourcing-based urban cellular traffic prediction problem, i.e., to predict the city-scale fine-grained cellular traffic patterns based on partial user-generated measurements. We propose a novel deep generative adversarial network (GAN) model called CrowdGAN to solve the problem. Specifically, CrowdGAN employs a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract spatio-temporal features from sparse traffic maps, and adopts a novel design of co-training a generator and a discriminator under the supervision of an accuracy assurance network to generate a high-resolution cellular traffic map for prediction. We implement the proposed CrowdGAN in TensorFlow and evaluate its performance using two real-world cellular traffic datasets. Extensive experiments show that CrowdGAN significantly outperforms the baselines on a variety of performance metrics, and achieves at least 47% reduction in root-mean-squared error compared to the state-of-the-art.",
    "In the past, the research on models related to urban land-use change and prediction was greatly complicated by the high precision of models. When planning some garden cities, we should explore a more applicable, specific, and effective macro approach than the community-level one. In this study, a model consisting of spatial autoregressive (SAR), cellular automata (CA), and Markov chains is constructed. One It can well-consider the spatial autocorrelation and integrate the advantages of CA into a geographical simulation to find the driving forces behind the expansion of a garden city. This framework has been applied to the urban planning and development of Chengdu, China. The research results show that the application of the SAR model shows the development trend in the southeast region and the needs to optimize the central region and protect the western region as an ecological reserve. The descriptive statistics and the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals are reliable. The influence of spatial variables from strong to weak is distance to water, slope, population density, GDP, distance to main roads, distance to railways, and distance to the center of the county (district). Taking 2005 as the initial year, the land-use situation in 2015 was simulated and compared with the actual land-use situation. It seems that the Kappa coefficient of the construction-land simulation is 0.7634, with high accuracy. Therefore, the land use in 2025 and 2035 is further simulated, which provides a reference for garden cities to formulate a reasonable urban space development strategy.",

    "This paper proposes a methodological framework for an interactive street network design that complements user-driven (i.e., procedural-based tools) and example-driven (i.e., learning-based tools) approaches in urban planning and design. The proposed framework consists of three components: (1) a data preparation module to link open-source road networks with human-labeled planning guidance, (2) a multi-stage deep learning (MSDL) model to reinforce the user-defined guidance in the automatic generation of street networks, and (3) a human-computer interaction (HCI) interface to enable the progressive design process. The performance and the working mechanism of the proposed framework were examined through experiments in four European cities (i.e., Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, and Prague). The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MSDL model can achieve a better predictive performance compared to benchmark models, particularly when limited planning guidance is given. These finding are revealed using either computer vision- or street network-related metrics. With less than 40% of the ground truth planning guidance used as an input, the MSDL model can perform as well as other models using 100% of the information. Furthermore, when embedded within an HCI system for user trials, the model can facilitate a human-computer collaborative design process. This advantage is derived from the model's ability to provide initial prototypes, timely responses to changed guidance, and quantifiable evaluations of the generated proposals. Suitable for professionals and laypersons, the proposed tool can inform plan-making and public engagement by offering realistic, enriched, and human-centered spatial proposal alternatives for comparison.",
    "This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4\u201316 variables). The VAE/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples.",

Results show that MetroGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art urban simulation methods by over 20% in all metrics. Inspiringly, using physical geography features singly, MetroGAN can still generate shapes of the cities.

    "To estimate the air quality regulation service provided by urban vegetation, this study integrated spatial analysis, a dry deposition model, and an atmospheric diffusion model to spatially quantify the air quality regulation service of PM2.5 in Taipei City on a high-resolution scale (30 m \u00d7 30 m per spatial unit). The results show that in 2016, total PM2.5 emissions in Taipei City were 1,400.88 tonnes and that urban vegetation removed 18.31 tonnes of PM2.5, with an average PM2.5 removal rate of 0.16 g/m2, and the corresponding PM2.5 concentration improvement value of 0.0136 \u03bcg/m3.

    "We propose a novel 'off-deployment traffic estimation problem', namely, to foresee the traffic condition changes of a region prior to the deployment of a construction plan. This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines. We also showcase that TrafficGAN can identify potential traffic issues in some regions and suggest possible reasons.",

This system incorporated the self-powered flexible sensors with net-zero power consumption based on the Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) and an intelligent analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI). The feasibility of the SSTIS was tested using the full-scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) and the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with a vehicle axle load classification accuracy up to 89.06%. This robust SSTIS was later tested on highway and collected around 869,600 pieces of signals data. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN - Gradient Penalty) was used for data augmentation, due to the imbalanced data of different vehicle types in actual traffic. The overall accuracy for on-road vehicle type classification improved to 81.06% using the convolutional neural network ResNet. Finally, we developed a mobile traffic signal information monitoring system based on cloud platform and Android framework, which enabled engineers to obtain the vehicle axle-load information mobilely. This study is the emerging design and engineering application of the self-powered flexible sensors for smart traffic monitoring, which provides a significant advance for intelligent transportation and smart cities in future.",
    "In this paper, we focus on inter-region traffic data completion. We model the inter-region traffic as a spatiotemporal tensor that suffers from missing measurements. To recover the missing data, we propose an enhanced CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) completion approach that considers the urban and temporal aspects of the traffic. To derive the urban characteristics, we divide the area of study into regions. Then, for each region, we compute urban feature vectors inspired from biodiversity which are used to compute the urban similarity matrix. To mine the temporal aspect, we first conduct an entropy analysis to determine the most regular time-series. Then, we conduct a joint Fourier and correlation analysis to compute its periodicity and construct the temporal matrix. Both urban and temporal matrices are fed into a modified CP-completion objective function. To solve this objective, we propose an alternating least square approach that operates on the vectorized version of the inputs. We conduct comprehensive comparative study with two evaluation scenarios. In the first one, we simulate random missing values. In the second scenario, we simulate missing values at a given area and time duration. Our results demonstrate that our approach provides effective recovering performance reaching 26% improvement compared to state-of-art CP approaches and 35% compared to state-of-art generative model-based approaches.",
    "To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time.",

    "The study of the spatial differentiation of COVID-19 in cities and its driving mechanism is helpful to reveal the spatial distribution pattern, transmission mechanism and diffusion model, and evolution mechanism of the epidemic and can lay the foundation for constructing the spatial dynamics model of the epidemic and provide theoretical basis for the policy design, spatial planning and implementation of epidemic prevention and control and social governance. Geodetector(Origin version,Beijing,PR China) is a great tool for analysis of spatial differentiation and its influencing factors, and it provides decision support for differentiated policy design and its implementation in executing the city-specific policies. Using factor detection and interaction analysis of Geodetector, 15 indicators of economic, social, ecological, and environmental dimensions were integrated, and 143 cities were selected for the empirical research in China. The research shows that, first of all, risks of both infection and death show positive spatial autocorrelation, but the geographical distribution of local spatial autocorrelation differs significantly between the two. Secondly, the inequalities in urban economic, social, and residential environments interact with COVID-19 spatial heterogeneity, with stronger explanatory power especially when multidimensional inequalities are superimposed. Thirdly, the spatial distribution and spread of COVID-19 are highly spatially heterogeneous and correlated due to the complex influence of multiple factors, with factors such as Area of Urban Construction Land, GDP, Industrial Smoke and Dust Emission, and Expenditure having the strongest influence, the factors such as Area of Green, Number of Hospital Beds and Parks, and Industrial NOx Emissions having unignorable influence, while the factors such as Number of Free Parks and Industrial Enterprises, Per-GDP, and Population Density play an indirect role mainly by means of interaction. Fourthly, the factor interaction effect from the infected person\u2019s perspective mainly shows a nonlinear enhancement effect, that is, the joint influence of the two factors is greater than the sum of their direct influences; but from the perspective of the dead, it mainly shows a two-factor enhancement effect, that is, the joint influence of the two factors is greater than the maximum of their direct influences but less than their sum. Fifthly, some suggestions are put forward from the perspectives of building a healthy, resilient, safe, and smart city, providing valuable reference and decision basis for city governments to carry out differentiated policy design.",

The moving person detection process is performed by applying a combination of advanced computer vision and machine learning solutions, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Aggregate Channel Features (ACF), to each frame of the color video sequence. An instance matching-based tracking technique that uses a deep learning-based multiscale analysis of the subimages of the detected pedestrians is then proposed. Its scale-space is created by applying the numerical approximation algorithm of a well-posed nonlinear anisotropic diffusion-based model that is introduced here. The results of the pedestrian detection and tracking experiments are described in the end.",
    "To this end, we propose a new human-in-the-loop generative model, iPLAN, which is capable of automatically generating layouts, but also interacting with designers throughout the whole procedure, enabling humans and AI to co-evolve a sketchy idea gradually into the final design. iPLAN is evaluated on diverse datasets and compared with existing methods. The results show that iPLAN has high fidelity in producing similar layouts to those from human designers, great flexibility in accepting designer inputs and providing design suggestions accordingly, and strong generalizability when facing unseen design tasks and limited training data.",
    "In this chapter, we first show how incorporating Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) techniques in Human Trajectory Prediction allows to provide realistic estimates of the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties on the computed predictions.

    "Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in video prediction and image generation, in this paper we propose a Seq2Seq Spatial-Temporal Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks named STS-GAN for multi-step urban flow prediction. We regard citywide urban flow data in successive time steps as image frames of a video. Specifically, we first design a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Encoder (STSE) to capture relative semantic factors and spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously at each time step, which consists of Residual Convolution units. Then a Seq2Seq GAN model is proposed to generate a sequence of future urban flow predictions based on historical data. Furthermore, by integrating GAN\u2019s adversarial loss with prediction error, our STS-GAN can effectively address the blurry prediction issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale urban flow datasets in Beijing and Guangzhou, which demonstrate STS-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods.",
    "This chapter proposes a potential use case for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the planning and design process. GANs are used to develop novel impressionistic aerial imagery\u2014or urban impressions\u2014based on a variety of inputs common to practice such as variations of land use and/or land cover. The GANs make extensive use of readily-available, tiled, web-format maps in both their training and prediction. The generated urban impressions were evaluated based on a range of qualitative criteria, including their ability to foster increased dialogue between parties. Additionally, this research included the development of a prototype tool that creates urban impressions based on selected inputs early on in the predesign phase. Ultimately, it is the hope that this prototype \u201csketch tool\u201d will allow practitioners to use GANs to test out initial \u201csketched\u201d approaches in planning and design and communicate them to the client for early feedback.",
    "In line with this goal, this paper aims to develop a methodology for generating VRUs trajectories that accounts for behaviors and social interactions. We develop a receding horizon optimization-based pedestrian trajectory planning algorithm capable of modeling pedestrian trajectories in a variety of shared space scenarios. Focusing on three scenarios-group interactions, unidirectional interaction, and fixed obstacle interaction-case studies are performed to demonstrate the strengths of the resulting generative model. Additionally, generated trajectories are validated using two benchmark datasets - DUT and TrajNet++. The three case studies are shown to yield low or near-zero Mean Euclidean Distance and Final Displacement Error values supporting the performance validity of the models. We also analyze gait parameters (step length and step frequency) to further demonstrate the model's capability at generating realistic pedestrian trajectories.",
    "This work intends to solve the problem that the current artistic typeface generation methods rely too much on manual intervention, lack novelty, and the single font local feature and the global feature extraction method cannot fully describe the font features. Firstly, it proposes a handwritten word recognition model based on generalized search trees (GIST) and the pyramid histogram of oriented gradient (PHOG). The local features and global features of the font are fused. Secondly, a model of automatic artistic typeface generation based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) is constructed, which can use hand-drawn fonts to automatically generate artistic typefaces in the desired style through training as needed. Finally, the generation of the huaniao typeface is used as an example. By constructing the dataset, the effectiveness of the two models is verified. The experimental results show the following: (1) The proposed handwritten character recognition model based on GIST and PHOG has a higher recognition rate of different fonts than the single GIST and PHOG features by more than 5.8%. The total recognition time is reduced by more than 49.4%, and the performance is improved significantly. (2) Compared with other popular algorithms, the constructed GAN-based automatic artistic typeface generation model has the best quality of the generation of huaniao on both the pencil sketch and the calligraphy character image dataset. Models have broad application prospects in contemporary advertising text art design. This study aims to provide important technical support for the automation of contemporary advertising text art design and the improvement of overall efficiency.",

It uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to perform image-to-image translation, followed by segmentation and raster-vector comparison processes to identify changes to map features (e.g. buildings, roads, etc.) when compared to existing map data. This paper evaluates various GAN models trained with sixteen different datasets designed for use by our change detection/map updating procedure. Each GAN model is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively to select the most accurate DL model for use in future spatial change detection applications.",

The proposed model surpasses the existing generative model in RMSE, MAE, VAR, KL indicators, and is significantly better than the existing model in the MAE indicator. Our traffic generator is able to dynamically adjust urban traffics to generate different simulation environments.",
    "To accurately extract building regions from high-resolution remote sensing images, in this study, we propose a practical method for building extraction based on convolution neural networks (CNNs). Firstly, the multi-scale recurrent residual convolution is introduced into the generative network to extract the multi-scale and multi-resolution features of remote sensing images. Secondly, the attention gates skip connection (AGs) is used to enhance the information interaction between different scale features. Finally, the adversarial network with parallel architecture is used to decrease the difference between the extracted results and the ground truths. Moreover, the conditional information constraint is introduced in the training process to improve robustness and generalization ability of the proposed method. The qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed on IAILD and Massachusetts datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately and effectively extract building regions from remote sensing images.",

    "This article proposes a contingent diffusion model to examine the intra-regional adoption of local climate action plans within Southern California from 2000 to 2018. We find that neighboring jurisdictions that adopt climate policy increase the likelihood of a home city's adoption. Yet, neighboring effect is contingent on the home city's existing pro-environmental policy propensity. However, in contrast to conventional wisdom, this study finds no evidence that local environmental advocacy groups play a crucial role in the diffusion of municipal climate initiatives. Altogether, the results suggest that a regional diffusion model of policy innovations is more likely successful when adaptive capacity is in place to facilitate green infrastructure. These findings provide implications for policymakers and planners who want to achieve successful spillovers of urban climate policies across local governments.",
    "This study investigates the spatial heterogeneity of social media with regard to the regular intra-urban movements of residents by means of a case study of rainfall-related Twitter activity in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. We apply a spatial autoregressive model that uses population and income as covariates and intra-urban mobility flows as spatial weights to explain the spatial distribution of the social response to rainfall events in Twitter vis-\u00e0-vis rainfall radar data. Results show high spatial heterogeneity in the response of social media to rainfall events, which is linked to intra-urban inequalities. Our model performance ((Formula presented.)) provides evidence that urban mobility flows and socio-economic indicators are significant factors to explain the spatial heterogeneity of thematic spatiotemporal patterns extracted from social media. Therefore, urban analytics research and practice should consider not only the influence of socio-economic profile of neighborhoods but also the spatial interaction introduced by intra-urban mobility flows to account for spatial heterogeneity when using social media data.",

Specifically, the model firstly constructs a Generator network which is composed of convolutional layer, residual block, and pixelshuffle block for the better potential distribution of the existing data, and then use the Discriminator network for the input judging. Experiments are conducted on the open-source TaxiBJ GPS dataset, and evaluated by the root mean square error (RMSE) index. The experimental results show that our model has the better accurate and reasonable performance than the traditional imputation methods.",

    "GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia). A large number of truthful reports make the verification of our model can effectively diagnose COVID-19 without compromising privacy.",
    "To this end, we propose a novel semisupervised scene classification method for RSI using generative adversarial nets (GANs), in which a gating unit, a self-attention gating (SAG) module, and a pretrained Inception V3 branch are introduced into discriminative network to enhance the feature representation capability for facilitating semisupervised classification. To be specific, the gating unit aims to learn the weights of each feature map and capture the dependence relationship between features. The SAG module aims to capture a long-range dependence for adaptively focusing on important scene regions. The Inception V3 branch aims to extract the high-level semantic representation of input images and further enhance the discriminant ability by gating unit and SAG module. Furthermore, a new optimization term is incorporated into the generator loss to indirectly drive discriminator to correctly classify scene images. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experimental results on UC Merced and EuroSAT data sets demonstrate that the method surpasses most of the state-of-the-art semisupervised image classification methods significantly, especially when only few samples are tagged.",

    "By this approach, we transform the fine-grained population mapping problem into a one-shot transfer learning problem. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot transfer learning framework PSRNet to transfer spatialoral knowledge across cities from three views. From the view of network structure, we build a dense connection-based population mapping network with temporal feature enhancement to capture the complicated spatialoral correlation between population distributions of different granularities. From the view of data, we design a generative model to synthesize fine-grained population samples with POI distribution and the single fine-grained ground truth in data-scarce target city. From the view of optimization, after combining above structure and data, we propose a pixel-level adversarial domain adaption mechanism for universal feature extraction and knowledge transfer during training with scarce ground truth for supervision. Experiments on real-life datasets of 4 cities demonstrate that PSRNet has significant advantages over 8 state-of-the-art baselines by reducing RMSE and MAE by more than 25%. Our code and datasets are released in Github (https://github.com/erzhuoshao/PSRNet-CIKM).",

    "In this paper, we propose the Spatial, Temporal and Social Exploration and Preferential Return model (STS-EPR), which embeds mechanisms to capture the spatial, temporal, and social aspects together. We compare the trajectories produced by STS-EPR with respect to real-world trajectories and synthetic trajectories generated by two state-of-the-art generative models on a set of standard mobility measures. Our experiments conducted on an open dataset show that STS-EPR, overall, outperforms existing spatial-temporal or social models demonstrating the importance of modelling adequately the sociality to capture precisely all the other dimensions of human mobility. We further investigate the impact of the tile shape of the spatial tessellation on the performance of our model. STS-EPR, which is open-source and tested on open data, represents a step towards the design of a mechanistic data-driven model that captures all the aspects of human mobility comprehensively.",

    "Considering the spatial interactions between county scale and prefectural scale divisions and spatial spillover effects, this study employed a hierarchical spatial autoregressive model to investigate the impact of land urbanization on CO2 emissions in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) during 1995\u20132015. The results showed that CO2 emissions exhibited spatial clustering across the counties and prefectural cities in the YRD region. The prefectural cities with the High-High type were mainly concentrated in Shanghai, Suzhou and Nantong during 1995\u20132015, indicating that they were the main areas that required CO2 emissions reduction. Land urbanization has a positive effect on CO2 emissions; there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between land urbanization and CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions presented spatiotemporal variations between the county and prefectural scales in the YRD region. The spatial interactions between county scale and prefectural scale suggest that local governments should integrate their neighboring governments (higher and lower governments) to reduce CO2 emissions in the YRD. The population, GDP per capita, carbon intensity, and spatial factor also played a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions. The results provide useful information for low-carbon urbanization development in the YRD.",
    "We address this problem using semi-supervised deep learning with data of different modalities, e.g., physical sensor observations and social media data. Unlike most existing studies focusing on data of single modality, the proposed method makes use of data of multiple modalities that appear to complement and reinforce each other. Meanwhile, as the amount of labelled data in big data applications is usually extremely limited, we extend the multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network model to a semi-supervised architecture to characterise traffic events. We evaluate the model with a large, real-world dataset consisting of traffic sensor observations and social media data collected from the San Francisco Bay Area over a period of four months. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in extracting and classifying traffic events.",

    "In particular, multimodality and generalizability have been neglected the most, and this work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new datasets, metrics, and methods to help understand and predict vehicle trajectories. We propose and compare Deep Learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures; in particular, our GAN-3 model can be used to generate multiple predictions in multimodal scenarios. These approaches are evaluated with our newly proposed error metrics N-ADE and N-FDE, which normalize some biases in the standard Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics. Experiments have been conducted using newly collected datasets in four large Italian cities (Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin), considering different trajectory lengths to analyze error growth over a larger number of time-steps. The results prove that, although LSTM-based models are superior in unimodal scenarios, generative models perform best in those where the effects of multimodality are higher. Space-time and geographical analysis are performed, to prove the suitability of the proposed methodology for real cases and management services.",
    "This survey covers seven different topics, including stereo matching, monocular depth estimation, visual localization in large-scale scenes, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D geometric modeling, dynamic human modeling, and point cloud understanding. Although several surveys are now available in the area of 3D vision, this survey is different from few aspects. First, this study covers a wide range of topics in 3D vision and can therefore benefit a broad research community. On the contrary, most existing works mainly focus on a specific topic, such as depth estimation or point cloud learning. Second, this study mainly focuses on the progress in very recent years. Therefore, it can provide the readers with up-to-date information. Third, this paper presents a direct comparison between the progresses in China and abroad. The recent progress in depth image acquisition, including stereo matching and monocular depth estimation, is initially reviewed. The stereo matching algorithms are divided into non-end-to-end stereo matching, end-to-end stereo matching, and unsupervised stereo matching algorithms. The monocular depth estimation algorithms are categorized into depth regression networks and depth completion networks. The depth regression networks are further divided into encoder-decoder networks and composite networks. Then, the recent progress in visual localization, including visual localization in large-scale scenes and SLAM is reviewed. The visual localization algorithms for large-scale scenes are divided into end-to-end and non-end-to-end algorithms, and these non-end-to-end algorithms are further categorized into deep learning-based feature description algorithms, 2D image retrieval-based visual localization algorithms, 2D-3D matching-based visual localization algorithms, and visual localization algorithms based on the fusion of 2D image retrieval and 2D-3D matching. SLAM algorithms are divided into visual SLAM algorithms and multisensor fusion based SLAM algorithms. The recent progress in 3D modeling and understanding, including 3D geometric modeling, dynamic human modeling, and point cloud understanding is further reviewed. 3D geometric modeling algorithms consist of several components, including deep 3D representation learning, deep 3D generative models, structured representation learning and generative models, and deep learning-based 3D modeling. Dynamic human modeling algorithms are divided into multiview RGB modeling algorithms, single-depth camera-based and multiple-depth camera-based algorithms, and single-view RGB modeling methods. Point cloud understanding algorithms are further categorized into semantic segmentation methods and instance segmentation methods for point clouds. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we present the progress in 3D vision outside China. In Section 2, we introduce the progress of 3D vision in China. In Section 3, the 3D vision techniques developed in China and abroad are compared and analyzed. In Section 4, we point out several future research directions in the area.",
    "In this work, we propose TIED, a text-to-image encoder-decoder model for the simultaneous extraction of visual and textual information for vehicle track retrieval. The model consists of an encoder network that enforces the two modalities into a common latent space and a decoder network that performs an inverse mapping to the text descriptions. The method exploits visual semantic attributes of a target vehicle along with a cycle-consistency loss. The proposed method employs both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships to improve retrieval performance. Our system yields competitive performance achieving the 7th position in the Natural Language-Based Vehicle Retrieval public track of the 2021 NVIDIA AI City Challenge. We demonstrate that the proposed TIED model obtains six times higher Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) than the baseline, achieving an MRR of 15.48. The code and models will be made publicly available.",
    "In modern smart cities, an increasing number of businesses rely on social network marketing to capture potential customers and third-party delivery systems to serve them; this system is called \u201conline to offline\u201d. Consequently, the well-known business location planning problem, which is used to attract nearby offline users, must be redefined. Thus, we propose a novel influence diffusion model to simulate the spread of advertisements for a given location within the geo-social networks; this model considers the distance from the social network users to the location and other existing competitors. We present an approximation algorithm to evaluate the maximum influence that can be achieved for a location based on the diffusion model. Moreover, to efficiently select the optimal location (with the largest maximum influence spread) from multiple candidates, a clustering-based pruning strategy is proposed. Our experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",
    "This work considers the use of a passive WiFi radar (PWR) to monitor human activities. Real-time uncooperative monitoring of people has numerous applications ranging from smart cities and transport to IoT and security. In e-healthcare, PWR technology could be used for ambient assisted living and early detection of chronic health conditions. Large training datasets could drive forward machine-learning-focused research in the above applications. However, generating and labeling large volumes of high-quality, diverse radar datasets is an onerous task. Therefore, we present an open-source motion capture data-driven simulation tool, SimHumalator, that can generate large volumes of human micro-Doppler radar data at multiple IEEE WiFi standards(IEEE 802.11g, n, and ad). We qualitatively compare the micro-Doppler signatures generated through SimHumalator with the measured signatures. To create a more realistic training dataset, we artificially add noise to our clean simulated spectrograms. A noise distribution is directly learned from real radar measurements using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We observe improvements in the classification performances between 3 to 8%. Our results suggest that simulation data can be used to make adequate training data when the available measurement training support is low.",

The calculation uses the method of superposition of the diffusion concentration of the ground source and the ground source, and the Lagrangian coordinate system is determined by the cumulative map of the wind rose. When calculating the long-term average atmospheric concentration, a correction factor is introduced to correct for the effects of near-surface and underlying ground conditions. With the rapid development of China\u2019s economy, communication between people anytime and anywhere has become very important, and people\u2019s demand for and reliance on mobile communication is also increasing.

    "Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a conditional generative adversarial network (Ra-CGAN) with multilevel channel attention mechanism to segment remote sensing building objects. Method: A generative model with a multilevel channel attention mechanism is first built. The model is based on a coding and decoding structure that solves small target misses by fusing deep semantics and shallow details with attention. Second, a discriminative network is built and used to distinguish whether the input comes from the real label map or the segmentation map generated by the model. The segmentation result (accuracy and smoothness) is improved by correcting the difference between the two maps. The downsampling method without pooling is used in the discriminator to enhance the propagation of the gradient. Finally, the generated model and the discriminant model are alternately confronted for training through the constraint of the conditional variable of the labelled image. Learning the higher-order data distribution characteristics results in more continuity for the target space. The loss function uses a hybrid loss function, which comes from the cross-entropy loss function brought by the generated map and the real label map in the generation mode. The discriminator predicts the generated image as the loss value brought by the real label image. Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets. The first dataset has a dense building with many types and accurate labels, and can provide comprehensive, representative evaluation capabilities for the model. Another dataset with a higher segmentation difficulty is used to verify the robustness and scalability of the model. The lighting information and background information of the building are more complex than those of the first dataset. The experiment uses the PyTorch deep learning framework. The size of original image and the label image are unified to 512 \u00d7 512 pixels for training, the learning rate of Adam is set to 0.000 2, the momentum parameter is 0.5, the batch-size is 12, and the epoch is 200 times. Acceleration is performed using NVIDIA GTX TITAN Xp. Evaluation indicators include intersection over union (IOU), precision, recall, and F1-score. Result: Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets, and the methods are compared with the latest literature. Experimental results show that in the WHU dataset, the segmentation performance of the Ra-CGAN model is substantially improved compared with models without attention mechanism and adversarial training. Space continuity and integrity of the complex building and small building, and smoothness of building edges are considerably improved. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 3.75%, and F1-score is increased by 2.52%. Compared with the second-performance model, IOU value is increased by 1.1%, and F1-score is increased by 1.1%. In the Satellite Dataset II, Ra-CGAN obtains more ideal results in terms of target integrity and smoothness than other models, especially in the case of insufficient data samples. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 7.26%, and F1-score is increased by 6.68%. Compared with the second-placed model, IOU value is increased by 1.7% and F1-score is increased by 1.6%. Conclusion: A CGAN remote sensing building object segmentation model with multilevel channel attention mechanism, which combines the advantages of multilevel channel attention mechanism generation model and conditional generative adversarial networks, is proposed. Experimental results show that our model is superior to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Much more accurate remote sensing building object segmentation results are obtained on different datasets, proving that the model exhibits better robustness and scalability.",

    "To effectively improve the pedestrian gender recognition performance, a new method, called cascading scene and viewpoint feature learning (CSVFL), is proposed in this article. The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used pedestrian attribute data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CSVFL approach outperforms multiple recently reported pedestrian gender recognition methods.",
    "To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape\u2013pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.",
    "In this paper, a newfangled end-to-end model is proposed for advanced driving assistance based on the fusion of infrared and visible images, termed as FusionADA. In our model, we are committed to extracting and fusing the optimal texture details and salient thermal targets from the source images. To achieve this goal, our model constitutes an adversarial framework between the generator and the discriminator. Specifically, the generator aims to generate a fused image with basic intensity information together with the optimal texture details from source images, while the discriminator aims to force the fused image to restore the salient thermal targets from the source infrared image. In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on publicly available datasets RoadScene and TNO demonstrate the superiority of our FusionADA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Abstract: Contact with nature has long been associated with human health benefits, such as improved vitality and productivity, as well as reduced stress and anxiety. It also appears to impact educational outcomes; however, previous studies have reported mixed conclusions. These contradictory findings indicate that the underlying mechanism of this relationship is still unclear. This study examines the association between urban landscapes and school-level academic performance using data from 470 third-grade schools in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia. Measures of urban landscapes in each school attendance area (SAA) include tree canopy cover (%), grass (%), shrub (%), water (%), and impervious surface (%). Standardized test scores on English Language Arts (ELA), Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies were measures for academic performance. Spatial lag simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models were applied to determine associations between SAA vegetation and water and school-level academic achievement after accounting for demographic (e.g., percent Hispanic) and socioeconomic (e.g., percent students that are certified by National School Lunch Program) factors related to achievement. Tree canopy cover was significantly and positively related to academic performance, while percent grass and shrub covers had no significant associations. Percent water in SAA showed statistically significant and positive correlation with the mean science and social science scores, as well as students\u2019 proficiency level in social science. Findings from this study can help better plan urban environments.

    "In this work, we present the first generative model of city blocks named BlockPlanner, and showcase its ability to synthesize valid city blocks with varying land lots configurations. We propose a novel vectorized city block representation utilizing a ring topology and a two-tier graph to capture the global and local structures of a city block. Each land lot is abstracted into a vector representation covering both its 3D geometry and land use semantics. Such vectorized representation enables us to deploy a lightweight network to capture the underlying distribution of land lots configurations in a city block. To enforce intrinsic spatial constraints of a valid city block, a set of effective loss functions are imposed to shape rational results. We contribute a pilot city block dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our representation and framework over the state-of-the-art. Notably, our BlockPlanner is also able to edit and manipulate city blocks, enabling several useful applications, e.g., topology refinement and footprint generation.",

    "This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present extensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method.",

Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.",

    "In view of this, this paper proposes the attention-guided color consistency adversarial network (ACGAN). The algorithm takes the reference color style images and the images to be corrected in the same area and different phases as the training set and adopts the consistency adversarial network with the U-shaped attention mechanism to train the color consistency model. In the prediction stage, this model converts the hue of the images to that of the reference color style image, which is based on the reasoning ability of the deep learning model, instead of the corresponding reference color style image. This model transforms the hue of the images to be corrected into that of the reference color style images. This stage is based on the reasoning ability of the deep learning model, and the corresponding reference color style image is no longer needed. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, firstly, we compare the algorithm of this paper with the traditional image processing algorithm and other consistency adversarial network. The results show that the images after ACGAN color consistency processing are more similar to that of the reference color style images. Secondly, we carried out the building semantic segmentation experiment on the images processed by the above different color consistency algorithms, which proved that the method in this paper is more conducive to the impro-vement of the generalization ability of multi-temporal remote sensing image semantic segmentation model.",
    "In this paper, we investigate unsupervised anomaly detection on multidimensional time series data in IoT systems, and develops a GRU-based Gaussian Mixture VAE scheme, called GGM-VAE. In particular, we employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to discover the correlations among time series data, and use Gaussian Mixture priors in the latent space to characterize the multimodal data. Several previous works assume simple distributions for Gaussian Mixture priors, resulting in insufficient ability to fully capture the data patterns. To overcome this issue, we design a model selection mechanism during the training process under the guidance of Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) to find the model which can well estimate the distribution in the Gaussian Mixture latent space. We conduct extensive simulations on four datasets and observe that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection schemes and achieves up to 47.88% improvement in F1 scores on average.",
    "The study of location semantics has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields due to its wide applications such as location retrieval, location recommendation, data preprocessing and so on.

Fully utilizing the augmented image representations, GLGOD-Net then learns the fused representations into which both local and global latent features are implanted. Such fused representations learned by GLGOD-Net can be used to precisely detect different objects in remote sensing images. The proposed framework has been extensively tested on a real-world HSR image dataset for object detection and has been compared with several strong baselines. The remarkable experimental results validate the effectiveness of GLGOD-Net. The success of GLGOD-Net not only advances the cutting-edge of image data analytics, but also promotes the corresponding applicability of deep learning in remote sensing imagery.",

One-hundred-and-thirty landscape ecology metrics were computed: 18 class configuration metrics across seven land cover categories and four landscape diversity metrics. Anselin Moran's I-test was used to illustrate significant spatial patterns of well-being and landscape indicators; Pearson's correlation and conditional autoregressive (CAR) statistics were used to evaluate relationships between them.

In the generative model, we utilized SegNet model with Bi-directional Convolutional LSTM (BConvLSTM) to generate the segmentation map from Massachusetts building dataset containing high-resolution aerial imagery. BConvLSTM combines encoded features (containing of more local information) and decoded features (containing of more semantic information) to improve the performance of the model even with the presence of complex backgrounds and barriers.

The mean and the covariance, considered to be the parameters, are used in GMM-based training for the classifier. Support vector machine (SVM), a discriminative classifier, and the GMM, a generative model classifier, are the two most popular techniques. The classification strategy performances of both classifiers have better proficiency than other classifiers. By combining the SVM and GMM, it is possible to improve classification because estimating the parameters through GMM has very limited features; hence, there is no need to use any feature reduction techniques. The features extracted were used for the training of the classifiers. The testing of medical images for normality was performed with respect to the features that were trained.",

    "To partly fix that, we propose a deep learning framework (which we name FaceLift1) that is able to both beautify existing urban scenes (Google Street Views) and explain which urban elements make those transformed scenes beautiful. To quantitatively evaluate our framework, we cannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problem at hand has never been tackled before) and need to formulate new ones. These new metrics should ideally capture the presence (or absence) of elements that make urban spaces great. Upon a review of the urban planning literature, we identify five main metrics: walkability, green spaces, openness, landmarks and visual complexity. We find that, across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes meet the expectations set by the literature on what great spaces tend to be made of. This result is further confirmed by a 20-participant expert survey in which FaceLift has been found to be effective in promoting citizen participation. All this suggests that, in the future, as our framework's components are further researched and become better and more sophisticated, it is not hard to imagine technologies that will be able to accurately and efficiently support architects and planners in the design of the spaces we intuitively love.",

A crucial advantage of our method is that it learns a multi-scale metric to distinguish multiple objects at different distances under one image, while DCGAN serves as an encoder-decoder platform to generate parts of an image that contain better discriminative information. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) dataset, and it was demonstrated that the proposed new architecture achieved a much better detection rate, particularly on vehicles and pedestrians at distance, making it highly suitable for smart cities applications that need to discover key objects or pedestrians at distance.",

This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines.",
    "The article builds a diffusion model of urban atmospheric pollutant based on GIS technology, provides intuitive, scientific and effective data for assisting atmospheric pollution emergency work, and analyzes the atmospheric pollution diffusion simulation in Lanzhou City. At the same time, the calculation results are combined with urban planning to provide a theoretical basis for urban land layout. Results show that GIS has a wide range of applications in reaearch of the atmospheic pollutant, including data preprocessing, secondary development of models, and in displaying the output of computing results. MapObjects is introduced to confirm the feasibility of integrating atmospheric pollution diffusion research with GIS. The simulation study on the expansion of atmospheric pollutant in Lanzhou has found that the characteristics of atmospheric pollution are closely related to the distribution of pollution sources and topographical features.",
    "Here, we analyse a data set of more than 400, 000 Tweets in London to create a spatial point process model of Tweet clusters. We model Tweet clusters as a Poisson Cluster Process. We then track how the point process parameter and spatial entropy evolve over time to create a generative model usable for others, as well as discuss its relevance to urban dynamics and smart city applications.",

    "This paper aims to discover a mapping between live and dead phytoplankton. We propose PhytoGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network for the unpaired dead-tolive phytoplankton translation. We design a new PCALoss by extracting the principal component of the image to enhance the contour of the generated image. The addition of PCALoss can significantly improve the integrity of images. The experiments are carried out on the existing phytoplankton dataset. A series of experiments are discussed in the paper to demonstrate the performance of the domain transformation and the proposed loss functions. The experimental results indicate that PhytoGAN can produce more integral images of phytoplankton while completing the domain transformation compared with the existing methods.",
    "However, the high computational complexity and training instability are the main challenges of this framework. Accordingly, to address these problems, we propose several procedures for improving the training of Primal Wasserstein GANs. We test the effectiveness of our proposed procedures on MNIST, CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedroom and ImageNet-Dog category datasets, and the extensive experimental results confirm that our method is capable of generating high-quality images and obtaining high inception score. Importantly, we demonstrate that our method is more time efficient compared with other generative model techniques.",
    "In this paper, based on the state-of-the-art deep generative model Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder, we propose a Network Performance Prediction method using Generative Model (NPGM). This method builds the distribution of network latency features according to historical data with traffic taken as condition. Generative model can deal with hidden variables when building the model which traditional methods cannot handle. Following the ideology of phase space reconstruction, we conceal the numerous factors and map the inherent properties of network into a hidden vector. In order to speed up training process, we optimize parameters of neural networks with our Self-adaptive Stochastic Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO) instead of Gradient Descent (GD) algorithms. This approach applies self-adaptive coefficients and mutation operation, which improves training efficiency and searching accuracy. We propose a new criterion called Weighted Matrix Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WM-MAPE) to evaluate the predicting accuracy of latency matrices. We use real commercial backbone traffic data from the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis database. Results on validation sets show that inference error of our approach is less than 50% of time-series-based methods and SPSO has a significantly better efficiency and convergence compared with GD and PSO algorithms.",
    "In this paper, a fast and easy implementation method is proposed, which adopts the denoising loss of real data and the reconstruction loss of latent codes to deal with the training instability and mode collapse of generative adversarial networks (GAN). The features learned from the corrupted real data by the discriminator are used by the generator to recover real data. Since the denoising loss can estimate the local properties of data generation density, adding denoising loss to the GAN objective functions can improve the quality and diversity of generated samples. Adding reconstruction loss of latent codes to the generator further improves the performance of GAN. Therefore, the optimizing signal of the generator comes from three aspects: the adversarial loss like in standard GAN, the denoising loss of real data and the reconstruction loss of latent codes, which help to prevent the no gradient problem. We evaluate the quality and diversity of generated samples with the robust metric Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, a measure that can detect the intra-class mode dropping and is consistent with human assessment. In addition, we conduct a battery of experiments with the widely used architecture DCGAN and the complex architecture ResNet to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",
    "This work aims to use such system to transform the aerial images from UAVs into terrain map exploited by UGVs to perform ground path planning or navigation tasks. We propose a novel GAN-based active terrain mapping (GAN-ATM) algorithm which integrates Active Learning (AL) strategy into Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to build the terrain map efficiently with a very limited number of labeled data. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest predictive accuracy of 90.35%. Due to a more accurate terrain map, the UAV using GAN-ATM can plan the shortest trajectory among all existing counterparts.",
    "In this work, we examine the feasibility of applying Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) with Single Shot Detector (SSD) as data-processing technique to handle with the challenge of pedestrian detection in the wild. Specifically, we attempted to use in-fill completion to generate random transformations of images with missing pixels to expand existing labelled datasets. In our work, GAN's been trained intensively on low resolution images, in order to neutralize the challenges of the pedestrian detection in the wild, and considered humans, and few other classes for detection in smart cities. The object detector experiment performed by training GAN model along with SSD provided a substantial improvement in the results. This approach presents a very interesting overview in the current state of art on GAN networks for object detection. We used Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), Caltech, KITTI data set for training and testing the network under different resolutions and the experimental results with comparison been showed between DCGAN cascaded with SSD and SSD itself.",
    "This study employed the spatial autoregressive model to explore the effect of urban form on urban air quality in 288 prefecture-level cities in China. Information on the air quality (AQI) and six criteria pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, SO 2 , NO 2 , O 3 ) were obtained from the hourly observation data of 1333 in-situ air monitoring stations throughout 2015. Urban form is characterized by five metrics, including urban size, shape, sprawl, fragmentation and traffic accessibility, and it is calculated based on land cover data. Results show that urban shape complexity and population density have a significant negative impact on urban air quality. Large city size is strongly related to comparatively poor air quality for cities in Southern China and only shows a slight association with emissions in Northern China. In general, lower-sized, scattered, polycentric cities provide better air quality in China. It is suggested that higher air quality and fewer pollutant emissions can be achieved through urban form planning and management policies, which aim to restrict the blind expansion of urban land and encourage moderately scattered, polycentric urban development.",
    "In this paper, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework for depth map super-resolution that is able to preserve the smooth areas, as well as the sharp edges at the boundaries of the depth map. Our proposed model is trained on two different modalities, namely color images and depth maps. However, at test time, our model only requires the depth map in order to produce a higher resolution version. We evaluated our model both quantitatively and qualitatively, and our experiments show that our method performs better than existing state-of-the-art models.",
    "In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the per-pixel depths from a single image. Inspired by the recent works on generative neural network models, we formulate the task of depth estimation as a generative task where we synthesize an image of the depth map from a single Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) input image. We propose a novel generative adversarial network that has an encoder-decoder type generator with residual transposed convolution blocks trained with an adversarial loss. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several depth estimation works.",
    "This study developed a macro-level safety model for 263 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) within the urban area of Shanghai in order to examine the relationship between traffic crash frequency and road network, traffic, socio-economic characteristics, and land use features. To account for the spatial correlations among TAZs, a Bayesian conditional autoregressive negative binomial model was estimated, linking crash frequencies in each TAZ to several independent variables. Modeling results showed that higher crash frequencies are associated with greater populations, road densities, total length of major and minor arterials, trip frequencies, and with shorter intersection spacing. The results from this study can help transportation planners and managers identify the crash contributing factors, and can lead to the development of improved safety planning and management.",
    "This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM.",
    "Choosing the East Zhejiang region in China as a case study, this paper reveals the interaction effects between technology-driven urbanization and eco-environment, by compiling novel indexes for factors such as the degree of urbanization, environmental pressure, environmental protection, and environmental quality from 2005 to 2014, and adopting a data-intensive systemic approach. Differing from previous literature, an inverted \"U\" structure and panel vector autoregressive model are constructed to show that: (i) Given the acceleration of technology-driven urbanization, its surrounding eco-environment is still likely to be under greater pressure; (ii) the relationships between technology-driven urbanization and environmental factors in different regions are heterogeneous, either with a normal U-shaped curve or an inverted U-shaped curve; and (iii) the two-way interaction effects are significantly unbalanced, with long-term contribution rates of environmental quality and pressure on urbanization to be 57.8% and 78.88%, respectively, which is higher than the reversal effect. This study provides scientific reference for urban planning and advocates that more technological innovations should be implemented to help maintain sustainable urbanization processes.",
    "This paper presents a predictive approach based on spatial analysis and auto-regressive models to automatically detect high-risk crime regions in urban areas and to reliably forecast crime trends in each region. The algorithm result is a spatio-temporal crime forecasting model, composed of a set of crime-dense regions with associated crime predictors, each one representing a predictive model for estimating the number of crimes likely to occur in its associated region. The experimental evaluation was performed on two real-world datasets collected in the cities of Chicago and New York City. This evaluation shows that the proposed approach achieves good accuracy in spatial and temporal crime forecasting over rolling time horizons.",
    "Under the research project sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences NCHRP-IDEA program, a conventional sign detection algorithm based on color, shape, and texture has been developed to process the images of signs. The developed algorithm has been enhanced by digital image processing and deep-learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), and region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN). In this paper, a method is designed to process the images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), employing a model UAV, to further develop of our current research. The preliminary test shows that it is promising to use a UAV and machine learning to develop an expedited infrastructure condition evaluation following natural disasters because of its automatic and non-contact nature. The preliminary outcomes show the detection rates have satisfying FN rates and very low FP rates. Besides, the designed algorithm and data-gathering method provides a real-time and on-site computation capability that reduces the quantity of data to be stored by filtering out unnecessary data instantly."
