    "abstract": "Building rooftop extraction has been applied in various fields, such as cartography, urban planning, automatic driving, and intelligent city construction. Automatic building detection and extraction algorithms using high spatial resolution aerial images can provide precise location and geometry information, significantly reducing time, costs, and labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer, have robust local or global feature extraction ability, achieving advanced performance in intelligent interpretation compared with conventional methods. However, buildings often exhibit scale variation, spectral heterogeneity, and similarity with complex geometric shapes. Hence, the building rooftop extraction results exist fragmentation and lack spatial details using these methods. To address these issues, this study developed a multi-scale global perceptron network based on Transformer and CNN using novel encoder-decoders for enhancing contextual representation of buildings. Specifically, an improved multi-head-attention encoder is employed by constructing multi-scale tokens to enhance global semantic correlations. Meanwhile, the context refinement decoder is developed and synergistically uses high-level semantic representation and shallow features to restore spatial details. Overall, quantitative analysis and visual experiments confirmed that the proposed model is more efficient and superior to other state-of-the-art methods, with a 95.18% F1 score on the WHU dataset and a 93.29% F1 score on the Massub dataset.",

    "abstract": "Problem: Modernizing and standardizing place names and addresses is a key challenge in the development of smart cities. Purpose: This paper proposes a solution to address matching challenges, such as incomplete descriptions, reversed word order, and the diverse descriptions often found in Chinese addresses. Method: Leveraging the hierarchical structure of Chinese addresses, this study introduces the interactive address matching graph attention model (IAMGAM). In the IAMGAM, an attention-based feature interaction method (AFIM) is employed. To reflect the hierarchical nature of address elements, a directed graph is used to model the address data, and the model is trained and tested using a graph attention mechanism. Results: Experiments demonstrate that the IAMGAM achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 99.61%. Compared with the existing address matching methods, the IAMGAM improves the accuracy by 0.66% to 2.57%, and the F1-score by 0.68% to 2.55%, outperforming baseline models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component within the model. Furthermore, when fine-tuned using ChatGLM2-6B, the results show that the IAMGAM still outperforms ChatGLM2-6B. Conclusion: IAMGAM demonstrates excellent performance in Chinese address matching tasks, and the Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods, such as ChatGLM2-6B, show great potential for future development in this area.",

    "abstract": "Distributed multivariate time series anomaly detection is widely-used in industrial equipment monitoring, financial risk management, and smart cities. Although Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant interest and achieved decent performance in various scenarios, most existing FL-based distributed anomaly detection methods still face challenges including: inadequate detection performance in global model, insufficient essential features extraction caused by the fragmentation of local time series, and lack for practical anomaly localization. To address these challenges, we propose an Unsupervised Federated Hypernetwork Method for Distributed Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis (uFedHy-DisMTSADD). Specifically, we introduce a federated hypernetwork architecture that effectively mitigates the heterogeneity and fluctuations in distributed environments while protecting client data privacy. Then, we adopt the Series Conversion Normalization Transformer (SC Nor-Transformer) to tackle the timing bias due to model aggregation through series conversion. Series normalization improves the temporal dependence of capturing subsequences. Finally, uFedHy-DisMTSADD simultaneously localizes the root cause of the anomaly by reconstructing the anomaly scores obtained from each subsequence. We performed an extensive evaluation on nine datasets, in which uFedHy-DisMTSADD outperformed the existing state-of-the-art baseline average F1 score by 9.19% and the average AUROC by 2.41%. Moreover, the average localization fault accuracy of uFedHy-DisMTSADD is 9.23% higher than that of the optimal baseline method.

    "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy into power networks introduces challenges due to intermittency and unpredictability, making precise expansion planning essential. This research introduces a novel two-stage stochastic approach for distribution network expansion planning in smart grids with high renewable energy penetration, addressing uncertainty, risk, and distributed generators' remuneration. Key contributions include: the incorporation of third-party generation owners' economic remuneration into a risk-based stochastic model; the use of conditional value-at-risk to manage uncertainty and extreme events, with a detailed analysis of cost evolution for various confidence levels and risk aversion parameters; the optimization of energy storage systems sizing and placement, alongside the location and type of new power lines and substation transformers, ensuring a reliable and radial network topology; and the integration of multiple factors, including uncertainty, risk aversion, ESS allocation, remuneration, and reliability, into a unified model that ensures optimal network design under technical constraints. Tested on a 180-bus network in Leiria, Portugal and on a 13-bus smart city mockup from Salamanca, Spain, the approach proved economically viable, reducing extreme scenario costs by up to 34 % through CVaR-based risk management, and demonstrating its potential for sustainable, risk-averse network expansion.",

Existing POI methods, such as social media-based user generating and web crawling, either require massive human resources or cannot guarantee integrity and reliability. Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end POI extraction framework based on digital city is proposed. It is built of digital models, textures, tiles and other digital assets collected by aircraft. The extraction process for POIs consists of segmenting it into four sequential stages: collecting, segmentation, recognition and cleaning, each enhanced through fine-tuning on a proposed specialised digital scene dataset or via the development of tailored algorithms. Specifically, in the last stage, the application of large language model (LLM) is explored in the POI data cleaning field. By testing several LLMs of different scales using diverse chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies, the relatively optimal prompt scheme for different LLMs is identified regarding noise handling, formatted output and overall cleaning capability. Ultimately, POIs extracted through the proposed methodology exhibit superior quality and accuracy, surpassing the comprehensiveness of existing public commercial POI datasets, with the F1-score increased by 19.6%, 21.1% and 23.8% on Amap, Baidu and Google POI datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The efficient management and prediction of urban traffic flow are paramount in the age of beyond 5G smart cities and advanced transportation systems. Traditional methods often fail to handle the nonlinear and dynamic nature of traffic data, necessitating more advanced solutions. This paper introduces NeuroSync, a novel neural network architecture designed to leverage the strengths of spiking neuron layers and gated recurrent units (GRUs) combined with temporal pattern attention mechanisms to effectively forecast traffic patterns. The architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities inherent in nonstationary urban traffic datasets, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships within the data. NeuroSync not only outperforms traditional forecasting models such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing but also shows significant improvement over contemporary neural network approaches like LSTM, CNN, Seq2Seq, RNN, GRU, Transformer, and Autoencoder in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The model's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experiments with real-world traffic data, underscoring its potential to enhance urban mobility management and support the infrastructure of intelligent transportation systems.",

    "abstract": "In the construction of smart cities in the new era, traffic prediction is an important component. Precise traffic flow prediction faces significant challenges due to spatial heterogeneity, dynamic correlations, and uncertainty. Most existing methods typically learn from a single spatial or temporal perspective, or at best combine the two in a limited dual-perspective manner, which limits their ability to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Fusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MSTDFGRN) to address these limitations. The core idea is to learn dynamic spatial dependencies alongside both short- and long-term temporal patterns through multi-view learning. First, we introduce a multi-view spatial convolution module that dynamically fuses static and adaptive graphs in multiple subspaces to learn intrinsic and potential spatial dependencies of nodes. Simultaneously, in the temporal view, we design both short-range and long-range recurrent networks to aggregate spatial domain knowledge of nodes at multiple granularities and capture forward and backward temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we design a spatio-temporal attention model that applies an attention mechanism to each node, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on four real traffic flow datasets demonstrate MSTDFGRN's excellent predictive accuracy. Specifically, compared to the Spatial–Temporal Graph Attention Gated Recurrent Transformer Network model, our method improves the MAE by 4.69% on the PeMS08 dataset.",

    "introduction": "In the construction of smart cities in the new era, traffic prediction is an important component. Precise traffic flow prediction faces significant challenges due to spatial heterogeneity, dynamic correlations, and uncertainty. Most existing methods typically learn from a single spatial or temporal perspective, or at best combine the two in a limited dual-perspective manner, which limits their ability to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships.",

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "abstract": "Intersections are frequently identified as crash hotspots for roadways in major cities, leading to significant human casualties. We propose crash likelihood prediction as an effective strategy to proactively prevent intersection crashes. So far, no reliable models have been developed for intersections that effectively account for the variation in crash types and the cyclical nature of Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) and traffic flow. Moreover, the limited research available has primarily relied on sampling techniques to address data imbalance, without exploring alternative solutions. We develop an anomaly detection framework by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to predict the likelihood of cycle-level crashes at intersections. The model is built using high-resolution event data extracted from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM), including SPaT and traffic flow insights from 11 intersections in Seminole County, Florida. Our framework demonstrates a sensitivity of 76% in predicting crash events using highly imbalanced crash data along with real-world SPaT and traffic data, highlighting its potential for deployment at smart intersections. Overall, the results provide a roadmap for city-wide implementation at smart intersections, with the potential for multiple real-time solutions for impending crashes. These include adjustments in signal timing, driver warnings using various means, and more efficient emergency response, all with major implications for creating more livable and safe cities.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet of Things devices have progressively deployed in various applications including smart cities, intelligent transportation, healthcare, and agriculture. However, this widespread adaptation of the Internet of Things networks has been vulnerable to several attacks. Lack of security protocols, unauthorized access, and improper device updates lead the Internet of Things environment to several attacks, which impact network security and confidentiality of users. This paper develops an innovative approach that integrates Edge Implicit Weighting and Aggregated Graph Transformer architecture for accurate and timely intrusion detection. The proposed technique aggregates information from both one-hop and two-hop neighbors to derive immediate and extended relational context thereby improving the detection of complex attacks. This approach designs an Edge Implicit Weighting mechanism that allows the model to prioritize structurally significant relationships and enhance the accuracy of attack detection. The multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the detection of relevant patterns even in highly variable traffic scenarios. Further, the proposed framework incorporates the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to generate synthetic samples of minority classes to reduce class imbalance problems and attain balanced detection performance across all classes. The performance of the proposed detection technique is analyzed using multiple datasets with standard evaluation parameters. The proposed technique achieves outstanding performance results including an accuracy of 98.87% and a recall of 98.36%. From this experimental validation, it's clear that the proposed framework provides robust performance under diverse network conditions and handles imbalanced data effectively.",

    "abstract": "The intelligent design of shear wall structures is a critical aspect of smart construction, with a high demand for research and applications. Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart cities (SCs) rely on free-flow services streamlined by artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms. However, the nature of resource constraint prevails due to external infrastructure costs and energy-based allocations. Existing approaches to smart city resource distribution rely on static thresholds or reactive responses, which are not always sufficient. These approaches may limit system performance and scalability in dynamic IoT environments owing to increased energy consumption, postponed resource allocation, and frequent device failures. This article introduces a Concerted Resource Management (CRM) using the Leveled Reinforcement Training (LRT) method. The proposed method accurately identifies cost-complex and high energy-consuming sharing intervals based on service response time and device failure. The reinforcement learning and training concerts both energy and device incorporations for SC applications based on its demand. This process requires leveled training in resource management, from energy depletion to device activeness. The interrupted sessions are identified using resource allocation failures, and the active resources with optimal energy expenses are selected to pursue resource management. The training method thus identifies the demands based on independent or concerted resource allocations to mitigate the management constraints in an SC environment. This proposed method reduces the resource constraint-based waiting for allocations and allocation failures in any SC application services. Under the varying devices, the following is observed: Improvements: 9.1% (Allocation Rate), 10% (Device Detection), 11.88% (Constraint Mitigation— Energy), 9.06% (Constraint Mitigation—Resource Allocation); Reduced: 8.01% (Allocation Failure), 9.64% (Waiting Time).",

The reinforcement learning and training concerts both energy and device incorporations for SC applications based on its demand. This process requires leveled training in resource management, from energy depletion to device activeness. The interrupted sessions are identified using resource allocation failures, and the active resources with optimal energy expenses are selected to pursue resource management. The training method thus identifies the demands based on independent or concerted resource allocations to mitigate the management constraints in an SC environment. This proposed method reduces the resource constraint-based waiting for allocations and allocation failures in any SC application services. Under the varying devices, the following is observed: Improvements: 9.1% (Allocation Rate), 10% (Device Detection), 11.88% (Constraint Mitigation— Energy), 9.06% (Constraint Mitigation—Resource Allocation); Reduced: 8.01% (Allocation Failure), 9.64% (Waiting Time).",
    "introduction": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart cities (SCs) rely on free-flow services streamlined by artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms. However, the nature of resource constraint prevails due to external infrastructure costs and energy-based allocations. Existing approaches to smart city resource distribution rely on static thresholds or reactive responses, which are not always sufficient. These approaches may limit system performance and scalability in dynamic IoT environments owing to increased energy consumption, postponed resource allocation, and frequent device failures.",

    "abstract": "Highlights: What are the main findings? For smart city management, LLM-based multi-agent systems achieve 94–99% accuracy in routing urban queries and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLMs (0.30–0.38). Achievement of high scores in routing queries and response accuracy is possible with middle-size LLM models rather than the biggest LLM models. What is the implication of the main findings? The multi-agent LLM approach enables efficient processing of complex urban planning tasks while maintaining high relevance in responses, making it practical for real-world city management applications. LLM agents can effectively augment human decision making in urban planning by reducing task completion time from days to hours while maintaining accuracy and accountability in complex scenarios. This study investigates the implementation of LLM agents in smart city management, leveraging both the inherent language processing abilities of LLMs and the distributed problem solving capabilities of multi-agent systems for the improvement of urban decision making processes. A multi-agent system architecture combines LLMs with existing urban information systems to process complex queries and generate contextually relevant responses for urban planning and management. The research is focused on three main hypotheses testing: (1) LLM agents’ capability for effective routing and processing diverse urban queries, (2) the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology in improving response accuracy when working with local knowledge and regulations, and (3) the impact of integrating LLM agents with existing urban information systems. Our experimental results, based on a comprehensive validation dataset of 150 question–answer pairs, demonstrate significant improvements in decision support capabilities. The multi-agent system achieved pipeline selection accuracy of 94–99% across different models, while the integration of RAG technology improved response accuracy by 17% for strategic development queries and 55% for service accessibility questions. The combined use of document databases and service APIs resulted in the highest performance metrics (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLM responses (0.30–0.38). Using St. Petersburg’s Digital Urban Platform as a testbed, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach to create integrated city management systems with support complex urban decision making processes. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced urban management by providing empirical evidence of LLM agents’ effectiveness in processing heterogeneous urban data and supporting strategic planning decisions. Our findings suggest that LLM-based multi-agent systems can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of urban decision making while maintaining high relevance in responses.",

Whether for patent applicants or for patent examiners, more precisely labeling the TF for a certain patent is important for technological searches. However, determining the TF of a patent may be difficult and may even involve the strategic behavior of patenting, which can cause noise in patent classification systems (PCSs).

Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-LSTM, BERT and GPT-4 etc. Therefore, the proposed MLR model with a customized loss function could be moderately effective for patent classification within a specific technology theme, could have implications for patent classification and the TF resolution of patents, and could further enrich methodologies for patent mining and informetrics based on artificial intelligence (AI).",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction of surrounding traffic participants is vital for the driving safety of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs). It has been enabled with the help of the availability of multi-sensor information collected by ICVs. For accurately predicting the future movements of traffic agents, it is crucial to subtlety model the inter-agent interaction. However, existing works focus on the correlations between agents and the map information while neglecting the importance of directly modeling the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions, the direct modeling of which is beneficial for the representation of agent behaviors. Against this background, we propose to model the hyper-relational interaction, which incorporates map elements into the inter-agent interaction. To tackle the hyper-relational interaction, we propose a novel Hyper-relational Multi-modal Trajectory Prediction (HyperMTP) approach. Specifically, a hyper-relational driving graph is first constructed and the hyper-relational interaction is represented as the hyperedge, directly connecting to various nodes (i.e., agents and map elements). Then a structure-aware embedding initialization technique is developed to obtain unbiased initial embeddings. Afterward, hypergraph dual-attention networks are designed to capture correlations between graph elements while retaining the hyper-relational structure. Finally, a heterogeneous Transformer is devised to further capture the correlations between agents’ states and their corresponding hyper-relational interactions. Experimental results show that HyperMTP consistently outperforms the best-performing baseline with an average improvement of 4.8% across two real-world datasets. Moreover, HyperMTP also boosts the interpretability of trajectory prediction by quantifying the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions.",

    "abstract": "The infrared and visible fusion technology holds a pivotal position in smart city for cloud and fog computing, particularly in security system. By fusing infrared and visible image information, this technology enhances target identification, tracking and monitoring precision, bolstering overall system security. However, existing deep learning-based methods rely heavily on convolutional operations, which excel at extracting local features but have limited receptive fields, hampering global information capture. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce GRDATFusion, a novel end-to-end network comprising three key modules: transformer, gradient residual dense and attention residual. The gradient residual dense module extracts local complementary features, leveraging a dense-shaped network to retain potentially lost information. The attention residual module focuses on crucial input image details, while the transformer module captures global information and models long-range dependencies. Experiments on public datasets show that GRDATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in qualitative and quantitative assessments. Ablation studies validate our approach's advantages, and efficiency comparisons demonstrate its computational efficiency.

    "contribution": "To overcome this difficulty, we introduce GRDATFusion, a novel end-to-end network comprising three key modules: transformer, gradient residual dense and attention residual. The gradient residual dense module extracts local complementary features, leveraging a dense-shaped network to retain potentially lost information. The attention residual module focuses on crucial input image details, while the transformer module captures global information and models long-range dependencies. Experiments on public datasets show that GRDATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in qualitative and quantitative assessments. Ablation studies validate our approach's advantages, and efficiency comparisons demonstrate its computational efficiency. Therefore, our method makes the security systems in smart city with shorter delay and satisfies the real-time requirement.",
    "introduction": "The infrared and visible fusion technology holds a pivotal position in smart city for cloud and fog computing, particularly in security system. By fusing infrared and visible image information, this technology enhances target identification, tracking and monitoring precision, bolstering overall system security. However, existing deep learning-based methods rely heavily on convolutional operations, which excel at extracting local features but have limited receptive fields, hampering global information capture.",

    "abstract": "Building type information indicates the functional properties of buildings and plays a crucial role in smart city development and urban socioeconomic activities. Existing methods for classifying building types often face challenges in accurately distinguishing buildings between types while maintaining well-delineated boundaries, especially in complex urban environments. This study introduces a novel framework, i.e., CNN-Transformer cross-attention feature fusion network (CTCFNet), for building type classification from very high resolution remote sensing images. CTCFNet integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers using an interactive cross-encoder fusion module that enhances semantic feature learning and improves classification accuracy in complex scenarios. We develop an adaptive collaboration optimization module that applies human visual attention mechanisms to enhance the feature representation of building types and boundaries simultaneously. To address the scarcity of datasets in building type classification, we create two new datasets, i.e., the urban building type (UBT) dataset and the town building type (TBT) dataset, for model evaluation. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that CTCFNet outperforms popular CNNs, Transformers, and dual-encoder methods in identifying building types across various regions, achieving the highest mean intersection over union of 78.20% and 77.11%, F1 scores of 86.83% and 88.22%, and overall accuracy of 95.07% and 95.73% on the UBT and TBT datasets, respectively. We conclude that CTCFNet effectively addresses the challenges of high interclass similarity and intraclass inconsistency in complex scenes, yielding results with well-delineated building boundaries and accurate building types.",

    "abstract": "Fire detection has held stringent importance in computer vision for over half a century. The development of early fire detection strategies is pivotal to the realization of safe and smart cities, inhabitable in the future. However, the development of optimal fire and smoke detection models is hindered by limitations like publicly available datasets, lack of diversity, and class imbalance. In this work, we explore the possible ways forward to overcome these challenges posed by available datasets. We study the impact of a class-balanced dataset to improve the fire detection capability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-based models and propose the use of generative models for data augmentation, as a future work direction. First, a comparative analysis of two prominent object detection architectures, You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) and YOLOv8 has been carried out using a balanced dataset, where both models have been evaluated across various evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP). The results are compared to other recent fire detection models, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed YOLOv8 architecture as trained on our balanced dataset. Next, a fractal dimension analysis gives a deeper insight into the repetition of patterns in fire, and the effectiveness of the results has been demonstrated by a windowing-based inference approach. The proposed Slicing-Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) improves the fire and smoke detection capability of YOLOv8 for real-life applications with a significantly improved mAP performance over a strict confidence threshold. YOLOv8 with SAHI inference gives a mAP:50-95 improvement of more than 25% compared to the base YOLOv8 model. The study also provides insights into future work direction by exploring the potential of generative models like deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and diffusion models like stable diffusion, for data augmentation.",

    "abstract": "Joint communication and sensing (JC&S) is emerging as a key component in 5G and 6G networks, enabling the dynamic adaptation to environmental changes and enhancing contextual awareness for optimized communication. By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC&S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhancing power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors such as smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes multihead attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC&S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.

Governments across the world are increasingly promoting the construction of smart cities and intelligent security systems to safeguard the lives and property of citizens and maintain social stability. Person re-identification (ReID) is an essential technology for building smart cities, with significant implications for security monitoring and criminal investigation applications. The goal of person re-identification is to accurately identify specific individuals captured under different cameras. However, due to intra-class differences resulting from various factors such as illumination, viewpoint, occlusion, and pose, person re-identification remains a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Although existing fully supervised person re-identification methods have made significant progress, the scarcity of data and labels poses a bottleneck for further improving model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce a more complex and diverse synthetic dataset with easy-to-obtain labels for auxiliary training, and propose a novel camera-aware asymmetric adversarial learning (CAAL) method that overcomes intra-class variation among multiple cameras and the domain-shift between real data and synthetic data, enabling the learning of camera-invariant feature representations from diverse data sources. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of misleading information carried by synthetic datasets and prevent the model from overfitting to synthetic data during adversarial training, we propose using an auxiliary network trained on real-world data to constrain the training of the backbone network. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of cyber threats and the exponential growth of data-driven applications have necessitated the advancement of predictive analytics techniques in cybersecurity and data science. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as powerful tools for detecting, analyzing, and mitigating cyber threats while also enhancing decision-making processes in data science applications. This paper explores state-of-the-art ML and DL methodologies for predictive analytics, emphasizing their role in proactive security measures and intelligent data analysis. Traditional security approaches often struggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and volume of cyber threats. The integration of ML and DL offers dynamic, adaptive, and automated solutions that can identify anomalies, predict potential attacks, and strengthen defensive mechanisms.

    "abstract": "One of the challenges of the Internet of Things and smart cities is energy consumption and energy theft. An accurate approach to predicting energy consumption and detecting energy theft in smart cities increases efficiency and energy efficiency. Forecasting energy consumption makes energy production based on the needs of consumers, and detecting energy theft makes energy consumption forecasting models more accurate. In this manuscript, in the first step, the data set is balanced using the generative adversarial network based on game theory and the synthetic minority oversampling based on sample density method. In the second step, the basic features of the samples are selected with the Namib beetle optimization (NBO) algorithm to reduce the input of the CNN-LSTM model. In the third step, the hyperparameters of the CNN-LSTM model are optimized to reduce the prediction and classification error rate with the NBO algorithm. In the Benin Electricity Company dataset, the proposed method has fewer errors in predicting energy consumption than the LSTM, GRU, ARIMA-LSTM, and ARIMA-GRU methods. On the Individual Household Electric-Power Consumption dataset, the proposed method provides lower energy consumption prediction errors than convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and CNN-LSTM. The NBO algorithm optimizer CNN-LSTM hyperparameters more accurately than Coati optimization algorithm, jellyfish search optimization, Harris hawks optimization (HHO), and African vultures optimization algorithm. Experiments on the State Grid Corporation of China dataset showed that the proposed method's accuracy, sensitivity, and precision in predicting energy theft are 98.93, 98.32, and 96.78%. The proposed method is more accurate than CNN, DeepCNN, CNN-LSTM, and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) method.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution remote sensing images provide detailed surface information and are extensively utilized in urban planning, geographic monitoring, and smart city applications. Semantic segmentation, a crucial image analysis method, assigns pixel-level dense labels for scene understanding. However, this task faces challenges such as numerous small objects, complex shapes, detailed edge handling, and the effective fusion of multi-scale features. Existing methods often struggle to balance global information and local details, resulting in limited segmentation accuracy and efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel network architecture named FAttFormer, which leverages the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Within this architecture, we introduce two key modules: the Feature Attention Refinement Module (FARM) and the Multi-Scale Hybrid Attention (MSHA) module. The FAttFormer network is designed to significantly improve semantic segmentation accuracy and efficiency through multi-level and multi-scale feature fusion and refinement. Specifically, the FARM module focuses on effectively integrating encoder and decoder features to handle small objects and complex edges. The MSHA module enhances the ability to capture and integrate global and local information at different scales, further refining segmentation results. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that FAttFormer outperforms existing models in segmenting impervious surfaces and buildings, showing significant improvements in accuracy and detail preservation.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled researchers to develop tools to monitor real-world events and user behavior using social media platforms. Twitter is particularly useful for gathering invaluable information related to diseases and public health to build real-time disease surveillance systems. Such systems offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the passive, expensive, and time-consuming process of using data from healthcare organizations and hospitals. In this paper, we propose a novel system of TepiSense to automatically perform disease surveillance of epidemic-prone diseases. Our system classifies tweets related to diseases and further identifies 'indication' tweets that highlight the presence of patients. Our system consists of four distinct modules of pre-processor, feature extractor, classifier, and evaluator. TepiSense compares the performance of 3 feature extraction techniques, 9 machine/deep learning models, and 3 Large Language Models (LLMs). To test the performance of our system, we build a dataset of Twitter Epidemic Surveillance Corpus (TESC) containing 23.9K English and 13K labelled Urdu tweets related to six diseases: COVID19, hepatitis, malaria, flu, dengue, and HIV/AIDS. Our results show that mBERT LLM achieves the highest F-measure values of 0.96 and 0.83 for topic and indication tweets classification, respectively. Furthermore, we compute the correlation of signals generated by our system with real-world cases to test the efficacy on COVID19 disease. We notice that real-world cases have a correlation of 0.58-0.63 with the indication category tweets. Finally, we develop an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to disseminate the analytics of our system. Overall, our system offers a powerful tool for real-time disease surveillance using social media with potential implications for public health policy and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are crucial for the development and operation of smart cities, addressing key challenges in efficiency, productivity, and environmental sustainability. This paper comprehensively reviews the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in optimizing ITS. Initially, we provide an extensive overview of ITS, highlighting its components, operational principles, and overall effectiveness. We then delve into the theoretical background of various LLM techniques, such as GPT, T5, CTRL, and BERT, elucidating their relevance to ITS applications. Following this, we examine the wide-ranging applications of LLMs within ITS, including traffic flow prediction, vehicle detection and classification, autonomous driving, traffic sign recognition, and pedestrian detection. Our analysis reveals how these advanced models can significantly enhance traffic management and safety.

Semantic communication (SC), as the next-generation communication technology, serves as a bridge for surpassing the Shannon limit toward the 6G wireless network. Establishing air-ground SC to provide intelligent IoT services is a crucial initiative for building future smart cities. In this paper, we propose a UAV-based SC framework, named diffusion joint source-channel coding (D-JSCC). Abandoning traditional convolutional neural networks, we use transformers as the backbone and innovatively incorporate the diffusion model (DM) for image enhancement, achieving an optimal balance between image distortion and human perception. To accurately capture the numerical and perceptual loss induced by wireless channels and seamlessly amalgamate the DM with SC, we integrate channel states as strong prior information to refine the sampling process. Furthermore, we employ the gradient guidance strategy, which counteracts the randomness of sampling ensuring high robustness in harsh communication conditions. Additionally, we strike a balance between performance and sampling steps, ensuring both efficient computation and high-quality image enhancement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of D-JSCC across different communication environments.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the internet of things and smart cities, the demand for effective spectrum collaboration has grown significantly. Radio maps play a crucial role in understanding the spatial radio environment, which is essential for wireless applications such as cell planning and radio resource management. However, generating radio maps is a resource-intensive task, as the construction process is complex and the distribution process consumes substantial bandwidth. This article proposes a method that combines semantic communication (SemCom) and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to optimize the construction and distribution processes of radio maps. By incorporating SemCom, our method transmits only key semantic information during the distribution process, significantly reducing bandwidth usage while ensuring accurate and efficient information transfer. While the diverse generative capabilities of GAI introduce some instability, which could be a limitation in radio map construction, this article achieves precise content decoding through prompts based on multi-modal semantic information, enabling accurate construction and restoration of radio maps. By utilizing SemCom and GAI technologies, the cost of applications of radio maps can be significantly reduced, which is beneficial for stimulating the pace of intelligence evolution in future mobile networks.",

These scenarios rely on real-time and efficient target-tracking capabilities for accurate perception and intelligent analysis of dynamic environments. However, traditional video instance segmentation methods face complex models, high computational overheads, and slow segmentation speeds in time-series feature extraction, especially in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, a Dual-Channel and Frequency-Aware Approach for Lightweight Video Instance Segmentation (DCFA-LVIS) is proposed in this paper. In feature extraction, a DCEResNet backbone network structure based on a dual-channel feature enhancement mechanism is designed to improve the model’s accuracy by enhancing the feature extraction and representation capabilities. In instance tracking, a dual-frequency perceptual enhancement network structure is constructed, which uses an independent instance query mechanism to capture temporal information and combines with a frequency-aware attention mechanism to capture instance features on different attention layers of high and low frequencies, respectively, to effectively reduce the complexity of the model, decrease the number of parameters, and improve the segmentation efficiency. Experiments show that the model proposed in this paper achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with few parameters on the YouTube-VIS dataset, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality. This method significantly enhances the application efficiency and adaptability of visual perception intelligent sensing technology in video data acquisition and processing, providing strong support for its widespread deployment.",

Existing methods, typically based on single-route, sparse stop data, struggle with the complex spatiotemporal interactions present in dense stop areas and multi-route networks, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a frontend-enhanced time-series prediction network, in which the Multi-Relational Modeling Graph Convolution (MRMGCN) as the frontend-enhanced module, called FEN-MRMGCN. The proposed module captures spatial relationships in dense, multi-route areas by using graph convolution layers based on multi-relational modeling to aggregate spatial information. The network then uses a conventional time-series model to capture temporal dynamics. Our approach effectively combines external factors, such as traffic congestion and weather conditions, particularly in dense bus route areas, thereby significantly enhancing bus arrival time prediction accuracy. Moreover, we compile and analyze a comprehensive dataset comprising passenger flow, traffic conditions, weather information, and arrival times for both densely populated bus stop areas and regular areas in Macao. Experimental results demonstrate that our frontend-enhanced network achieves a reduction in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 15.36%, 13.44%, and 19.07% compared to traditional time series forecasting models like CNN, LSTM, and Transformer, respectively.

    "abstract": "Analyzing and comprehending check-in sequences is crucial for various applications in smart cities. However, publicly available check-in datasets are often limited in scale due to privacy concerns. This poses a significant obstacle to academic research and downstream applications. Thus, it is urgent to generate realistic check-in datasets. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) as one of the most capable generation methods is a good choice to achieve this goal. However, generating check-in sequences using DDPM is not an easy feat. The difficulties lie in handling check-in sequences of variable lengths and capturing the correlation from check-in sequences’ distinct characteristics. This paper addresses the challenges by proposing a Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Diffusion Model (STCDM). This model introduces a novel spatio-temporal lossless encoding method that effectively encodes check-in sequences into a suitable format with equal length. Furthermore, we capture the spatio-temporal correlations with two disentangled diffusion modules to reduce the impact of the difference between spatial and temporal characteristics. Finally, we incorporate contrastive learning to enhance the relationship between diffusion modules. We generate four realistic datasets in different scenarios using STCDM and design four metrics for comparison. Experiments demonstrate that our generated datasets are more realistic and free of privacy leakage.",

    "abstract": "With the development and widespread application of network information, new technologies led by 5G are emerging, resulting in an increasingly complex network security environment and more diverse attack methods. Unlike traditional networks, 5G networks feature higher connection density, faster data transmission speeds, and lower latency, which are widely applied in scenarios such as smart cities, the Internet of Things, and autonomous driving. The vast amounts of sensitive data generated by these applications become primary targets during the processes of collection and secure sharing, and unauthorized access or tampering could lead to severe data breaches and integrity issues. However, as 5G networks extensively employ encryption technologies to protect data transmission, attackers can hide malicious content within encrypted communication, rendering traditional content-based traffic detection methods ineffective for identifying malicious encrypted traffic. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a malicious encrypted traffic detection method based on reconstructive domain adaptation and adversarial hybrid neural networks. The proposed method integrates generative adversarial networks with ResNet, ResNeXt, and DenseNet to construct an adversarial hybrid neural network, aiming to tackle the challenges of encrypted traffic detection. On this basis, a reconstructive domain adaptation module is introduced to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain, thereby enhancing cross-domain detection capabilities. By preprocessing traffic data from public datasets, the proposed method is capable of extracting deep features from encrypted traffic without the need for decryption. The generator utilizes the adversarial hybrid neural network module to generate realistic malicious encrypted traffic samples, while the discriminator achieves sample classification through high-dimensional feature extraction. Additionally, the domain classifier within the reconstructive domain adaptation module further improves the model’s stability and generalization across different network environments and time periods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of malicious encrypted traffic detection in 5G network environments, effectively enhancing the detection performance of malicious traffic in 5G networks.",

    "introduction": "With the development and widespread application of network information, new technologies led by 5G are emerging, resulting in an increasingly complex network security environment and more diverse attack methods. Unlike traditional networks, 5G networks feature higher connection density, faster data transmission speeds, and lower latency, which are widely applied in scenarios such as smart cities, the Internet of Things, and autonomous driving. The vast amounts of sensitive data generated by these applications become primary targets during the processes of collection and secure sharing, and unauthorized access or tampering could lead to severe data breaches and integrity issues. However, as 5G networks extensively employ encryption technologies to protect data transmission, attackers can hide malicious content within encrypted communication, rendering traditional content-based traffic detection methods ineffective for identifying malicious encrypted traffic.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extensively used in event monitoring and tracking, particularly in scenarios that require minimal human intervention. However, a key challenge in WSNs is the short lifespan of sensor nodes (SN), as continuous sensing leads to rapid battery depletion. In high-traffic areas, sensors located near the sink node exhaust their energy quickly, creating an energy-hole issue. As a result, optimizing energy usage is a significant challenge for WSN-assisted applications. To address this, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Routing and Cluster Head Selection in Wireless Sensor Network through an Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network for Golden Search Optimization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Network (EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA). This method involves selecting the Cluster Head (CH) using Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network (ADRGAN), minimizing energy consumption, and reducing a number of dead sensor nodes. Subsequently, Golden Search Optimization Algorithm (GSOA) is employed to determine an optimal path for data transmission to the sink node, maximizing energy efficiency, and elongating sensor node lifespan. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA method is simulated in MATLAB. The performance metrics, such as network lifetime, number of alive nodes, number of dead nodes, throughput, energy consumption, and packet delivery ratio is examined. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA demonstrates improved performance, achieving a higher average throughput of 0.93 Mbps, and lower average energy consumption of 0.39 mJ compared with the existing methods. These improvements have significant real-world implications for enhancing the efficiency and longevity of WSNs in applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and industrial automation.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, intelligent transportation systems have played a pivotal role in the development of smart cities, with vehicle retrieval becoming a critical component of traffic management and surveillance. Traditional vehicle retrieval systems rely heavily on image-based matching techniques derived from vehicle re-identification (VReID) tasks. However, these approaches are limited by their dependency on image queries, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios. Natural language (NL)-based vehicle retrieval systems offer a more flexible and accessible alternative by enabling users to query vehicles using textual descriptions. Despite progress in NL-based retrieval, existing methods face challenges in fully capturing multi-granularity information and aligning heterogeneous visual and linguistic inputs. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a robust Multimodal Vehicle Retrieval (MVR) model that integrates both visual and textual data through a dual-stream architecture. Our model captures complementary local features, alongside global information including motion and environmental context. We utilize InfoNCE and instance losses to align the visual and textual modalities within a shared feature space, while post-processing modules, including Granular Vehicle Feature Refinement and Spatial Relationship Modeling, further enhance retrieval performance by refining vehicle attributes and contextual relationships. Our experiments, conducted on the CityFlow-NL dataset, demonstrate that our model achieves a 35.6% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), a 41.3% increase in recall at 5 (R@5), and a 22.9% improvement in recall at 10 (R@10) compared to the baseline, and overcomes the inherent challenges of cross-modal retrieval in improving real-world VReID.",

Our research introduces a groundbreaking method for detecting skin cancer, using a new type of artificial intelligence called a Vision Transformer. This model analyzes a wide range of skin images from different people and accurately identifies skin cancer, especially melanoma and benign moles.Moving beyond traditional techniques like convolutional neural networks, our approach uses advanced attentionmechanisms to improve accuracy by focusing on key areas in the skin images. The model has been thoroughly tested with specific criteria to ensure it can reliably detect skin cancer while reducing errors. This research is particularly important as skin cancer rates are increasing worldwide, and early, accurate detection is vital for saving lives.

However, service time prediction (STP) is non-trivial given complex delivery circumstances, location heterogeneity, and skewed observations in space, which are not well-handled by existing solutions. In our prior work, we treat STP at each location as a learning task to keep the location heterogeneity, propose a prior knowledge-enhanced meta-learning to tackle skewed observations, and introduce a Transformer-based representation module to encode complex delivery circumstances. Maintaining the design principles of prior work, in this extended paper, we propose MetaSTP+. In addition to fusing the prior knowledge after the meta-learning process, MetaSTP+ also injects the prior knowledge before and during the meta-learning process to better tackle skewed observations. More specifically, MetaSTP+ completes the support set of tasks with scarce samples from other tasks based on prior knowledge and is equipped with a prior knowledge-aware historical observation encoding module to achieve those purposes accordingly. Experiments show MetaSTP+ outperforms the best baseline by 11.2% and 8.4% on two real-world datasets. Finally, an intelligent waybill assignment system based on MetaSTP+ is deployed in JD Logistics.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction has emerged as a critical component in advancing smart cities. Nevertheless, precisely forecasting traffic flow remains a formidable challenge, attributable to the intricate and dynamic spatiotemporal interdependencies inherent within traffic data. Contemporary methodologies often overlook the different impacts exerted at each timestamp and treat temporal correlations, rendering them incapable of extracting temporal patterns at multiple scales. Furthermore, these approaches fail to account for the neighboring and functional relationships among nodes within the spatial module. In this work, we introduce an innovative Multiscale and Gated transFormer (MSGFormer) architecture, MSGFormer, to overcome the inherent limitations for accurate traffic flow estimation. We have introduced a multiscale sampling strategy wherein we sample from the original data at three scales: 1) recent; 2) daily; and 3) weekly. This approach enables the generation of corresponding subsequences that encapsulate temporal information across different granularities. Subsequently, each generated subsequence is projected into a latent space and systematically combined with positional, temporal, and spatial embeddings. The positional embedding comprises relative positional embedding and time stamp embedding corresponding to days and weeks, aiming at capturing the sequential and cyclical characteristics of the data. Furthermore, at the inception of the transformer encoder, a gated unit, composed of a neighboring mask and a functioning mask, is employed to capture both static and dynamic spatial correlations effectively. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on four real-world traffic data sets. The experimental results robustly validate that our model attains significantly higher predictive accuracy in comparison to other baseline models.",

Recently, we are witnessing a rising trend that utilizes various deep-learning methods to facilitate cross-domain data fusion in smart cities. To this end, we propose the first survey that systematically reviews the latest advancements in deep learning-based data fusion methods tailored for urban computing. Specifically, we first delve into data perspective to comprehend the role of each modality and data source. Secondly, we classify the methodology into four primary categories: feature-based, alignment-based, contrast-based, and generation-based fusion methods. Thirdly, we further categorize multi-modal urban applications into seven types: urban planning, transportation, economy, public safety, society, environment, and energy. Compared with previous surveys, we focus more on the synergy of deep learning methods with urban computing applications. Furthermore, we shed light on the interplay between Large Language Models (LLMs) and urban computing, postulating future research directions that could revolutionize the field. We firmly believe that the taxonomy, progress, and prospects delineated in our survey stand poised to significantly enrich the research community.

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a rapidly burgeoning field demonstrating significant potential in creating diverse content intelligently and automatically. To support such artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) services, future communication systems must fulfill stringent requirements, including high data rates, throughput, and low latency, while efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SemCom) has been deemed as a revolutionary communication scheme to tackle this challenge by conveying the meaning of messages instead of bit reproduction. GAI algorithms serve as the foundation for enabling intelligent and efficient SemCom systems in terms of model pre-training and fine-tuning, knowledge base construction, and resource allocation. Conversely, SemCom can provide AIGC services with low latency and high reliability due to its ability to perform semantic-aware encoding and compression of data, as well as knowledge- and context-based reasoning. In this survey, we break new ground by investigating the architecture, wireless communication schemes, and network management of GAI-driven SemCom networks. We first introduce a novel architecture for GAI-driven SemCom networks, comprising the data plane, physical infrastructure, and network control plane. In turn, we provide an in-depth analysis of the transceiver design and semantic effectiveness calculation of end-to-end GAI-driven SemCom systems. Subsequently, we present innovative generation level and knowledge management strategies in the proposed networks, including knowledge construction, update, and sharing, ensuring accurate and timely knowledge-based reasoning. Finally, we explore several promising use cases, i.e., autonomous driving, smart cities, and the Metaverse, to provide a comprehensive understanding and future direction of GAI-driven SemCom networks.",

    "abstract": "In the environmental security monitoring of smart cities, the infrared and visible image fusion method deployed on intelligent systems based on cloud and fog computing plays a vital role in providing enhanced images for target detection systems. However, the fusion quality can be significantly influenced by the illumination of the monitoring scenario in visible images. Therefore, conventional methods typically suffer a severe performance drop under the condition of insufficient illumination. To tackle this issue, we propose an illumination enhancement and target-aware fusion method-based on artificial intelligence, which breaks the boundaries between the task of illumination enhancement and image fusion and provide a fusion result with better visual perception in nighttime scene. Specifically, we use a light-weight contrast enhancement module restore the brightness of the visible image. Moreover, a Swin Transformer-based backbone network is utilized to facilitate information exchange between the source images and enhance the capabilities of target awareness. Finally, the fused images are reconstructed by the contrast-texture retention module and reconstructor. The extensive experiments indicate that the proposed approach achieves improved performance both in human perception and quantitative analysis compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

This study evaluated the effects of a specialised AI literacy course designed for business students at a university in Hong Kong. The course aimed to equip participants with a basic understanding of AI concepts via self-paced materials, hands-on activities, case study discussion, and design thinking activities. Through a mixed-methods approach involving evaluation surveys and student and teacher reflections, this case study examined how effectively the course developed the students' AI literacies as future business leaders and global digital citizens. AI competencies include understanding basic AI and generative AI (GenAI), using AI applications ethically, critically analysing AI-powered systems, identifying potential societal risks, and making data-driven decisions while upholding ethical principles.

    "abstract": "Customer satisfaction is not just a significant factor but a cornerstone for smart cities and their organizations that offer services to people. It enhances the organization’s reputation and profitability and drastically raises the chances of returning customers. Unfortunately, customer support service through online chat is often not rated by customers to help improve the service. This study employs artificial intelligence and data augmentation to predict customer satisfaction ratings from conversations by analyzing the responses of customers and service providers. For the study, the authors obtained actual conversations between customers and real agents from the call center database of Jeddah Municipality that were rated by customers on a scale of 1–5. They trained and tested five prediction models with approaches based on logistic regression, random forest, and ensemble-based deep learning, and fine-tuned two pre-trained recent models: ArabicT5 and SaudiBERT. Then, they repeated training and testing models after applying a data augmentation technique using the generative artificial intelligence, GPT-4, to improve the unbalance in customer conversation data. The study found that the ensemble-based deep learning approach best predicts the five-, three-, and two-class classifications. Moreover, data augmentation improved accuracy using the ensemble-based deep learning model with a 1.69% increase and the logistic regression model with a 3.84% increase. This study contributes to the advancement of Arabic opinion mining, as it is the first to report the performance of determining customer satisfaction levels using Arabic conversation data. The implications of this study are significant, as the findings can be applied to improve customer service in various organizations.",

    "abstract": "Semi-structured decisions, which fall between highly structured and unstructured decision types, rely on human intuition and experience for the final choice, while using data and analytical models to generate tentative solutions. These processes are traditionally iterative and time-consuming, requiring cycles of data gathering, analysis, and option evaluation. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization techniques to streamline such decision-making processes. In our approach, LLMs leverage their capabilities in data interpretation, common-sense reasoning, and mathematical modeling to assist decision makers by reducing cognitive load. They achieve this by automating aspects of information processing and option evaluation, while preserving human oversight as a crucial component of the final decision-making process. Another significant strength of our framework lies in its potential to drive the evolution of a new generation of decision support systems (DSSs). Unlike traditional systems that rely on rigid and inflexible interfaces, our approach enables users to express their preferences in a more natural, intuitive, and adaptable manner, substantially enhancing both usability and accessibility. A case study on last-mile delivery system design in a smart city demonstrates the practical application of this framework. The results suggest that our approach has the potential to simplify the decision-making process and improve efficiency by reducing cognitive load, enhancing user experience, and facilitating more intuitive interactions.",

    "abstract": "Efficient traffic flow is crucial for sustainable cities, as it directly impacts energy consumption, pollution levels, and overall quality of life. The integration of superficial intelligence, particularly transformer models, plays a significant role in enhancing the predictive capabilities for traffic management, thereby supporting sustainable urban development. In this survey, we explored the application of transformer models to predict and optimize traffic flow in sustainable cities. These models leverage advanced machine learning to capture intricate spatiotemporal patterns,thereby providing valuable insights for urban planners and traffic management centers. By systematically reviewing the literature, we emphasize the importance of transformer models in urban planning and sustainable resource use. Our study demonstrates how transformer models can learn complex spatiotemporal patterns from traffic data by incorporating both real-time and historical data to enhance prediction accuracy. This improved predictive capability aids the development of smart cities by reducing traffic congestion, facilitating smoother movement for city dwellers and tourists, and ultimately contributing to the sustainability goals of urban areas. This comprehensive review highlights the transformative potential of predictive modeling using transformer models, underscoring their critical role in optimizing urban infrastructure and promoting sustainable city development.",

This improved predictive capability aids the development of smart cities by reducing traffic congestion, facilitating smoother movement for city dwellers and tourists, and ultimately contributing to the sustainability goals of urban areas. This comprehensive review highlights the transformative potential of predictive modeling using transformer models, underscoring their critical role in optimizing urban infrastructure and promoting sustainable city development.",
    "introduction": "Efficient traffic flow is crucial for sustainable cities, as it directly impacts energy consumption, pollution levels, and overall quality of life. The integration of superficial intelligence, particularly transformer models, plays a significant role in enhancing the predictive capabilities for traffic management, thereby supporting sustainable urban development.",

    "abstract": "Emerging as a paradigmatic shift in urban development, smart cities harness the potential of advanced information and communication technologies to seamlessly integrate urban functions, optimize resource allocation, and improve the effectiveness of city management. Within the domain of smart education, the imperative application of Visual Question Answering (VQA) technology encounters significant limitations at the prevailing stage, particularly the absence of a robust Internet of Things (IoT) framework and the inadequate incorporation of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) within contemporary smart education paradigms, especially in addressing zero-shot VQA scenarios, which pose considerable challenges. In response to these constraints, this paper introduces an IoT-based smart city framework that is designed to refine the functionality and efficacy of educational systems. This framework is delineated into four cardinal layers: the data collection layer, data transmission layer, data management layer, and application layer. Furthermore, we introduce the innovative TeachVQA methodology at the application layer, synergizing VQA technology with extensive pre-trained language models, thereby considerably enhancing the dissemination and assimilation of educational content. Evaluative metrics in the VQAv2 and OKVQA datasets substantiate that the TeachVQA methodology not only outperforms existing VQA approaches, but also underscores its profound potential and practical relevance in the educational sector.",

The optimization of traffic flow, reduction of congestion, and improvement of the overall transportation system efficiency all depend on accurate traffic pattern projections. In order to overcome the difficulties caused by the complexity and diversity of urban traffic dynamics, this research suggests a unique method for multi-modal traffic forecasting combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based multi-source visual fusion. GNNs are employed in this method to capture the spatial connections between various road segments and to properly reflect the basic structure of the road network.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is employed to improve the model's feature selection process and choose the most pertinent features for traffic prediction, producing forecasts that are more effective and precise. Utilizing real-time data, the performance of the suggested strategy was assessed, enabling it to adjust to shifting traffic patterns and deliver precise projections for intelligent transportation management. The empirical outcomes show exceptional results of performance metrics for the proposed approach, achieving an amazing accuracy of 99%.

Feature selection via the Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA) reduces dimensionality, while a classification phase integrates the Graph Attention Network (GAN), specifically the Dual-channel GAN (DGAN). DGAN incorporates Node Attention Networks and Semantic Attention Networks to capture intricate IoT device interactions and detect anomalous behaviors like botnet activity. The model's accuracy is further boosted by leveraging both structural and semantic data with the Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA) for hyperparameter tuning.

    "abstract": "Industrial developments and consumption of massive amount of fossil fuels, vehicle pollution, and other calamities upsurges the AQI (Air Quality Index) of major cities in a drastic manner. Owing to these factors, it is important to take proactive measures for reducing the air pollution in order to avoid life- threatening consequence. Therefore, prediction of air quality is significant for improving the health of living beings as highly polluted regions have a higher concentration of pollutants mixed in the air, affecting the respiratory system and reducing the lifetime. To control pollution, AQI is used as a measure for estimating the pollutant content in the air. Even though many existing techniques have predicted AQI, enhancement is required in prediction algorithms with minimized loss. To address the challenges in traditional algorithms, the proposed smart cities-based AQI prediction intends to utilize the proposed regression algorithm in the dataset, namely Air- Quality-Data, which collected harmful pollutants on an hourly and daily basis from multiple cities in India between 2015 to 2020. To achieve prediction efficiency with reduced loss, pre-processing of input data is being performed using Deep GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). It performs the imputation of data in place of missing values to improve accurate prediction. Additionally, feature scaling normalizes independent real-data features to a fixed scale. With the processed data, regression is done through modified Stacked Attention GRU with KL divergence, which predicts Ernakulam, Chennai and Ahmedabad cities with higher, medium, and low levels of AQI in India. The performance of the proposed regression algorithm is measured using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Square Error), R2 (Coefficient of determination), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and better MAE, MSE, R2, MAPE and RMSE obtained by the model is 0.1013, 0.0134, 0.9479, 0.1152 and 0.1156. Internal assessment and comparative analysis performed with existing regression algorithms exhibit lower loss values obtained from the present research, which determines the efficacy of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Infrared (IR) human action recognition (AR) exhibits resilience against shifting illumination conditions, changes in appearance, and shadows. It has valuable applications in numerous areas of future sustainable and smart cities including robotics, intelligent systems, security, and transportation. However, current IR-based recognition approaches predominantly concentrate on spatial or local temporal information and often overlook the potential value of global temporal patterns. This oversight can lead to incomplete representations of body part movements and prevent accurate optimization of a network. Therefore, a contextual-motion coalescence network (CMCNet) is proposed that operates in a streamlined and end-to-end manner for robust action representation in darkness in a near-infrared (NIR) setting. Initially, data are preprocessed to separate foreground, normalized, and resized. The framework employs two parallel modules: the contextual visual features learning module (CVFLM) for local feature extraction, and the temporal optical flow learning module (TOFLM) for acquiring motion dynamics. These modules focus on action-relevant regions used shift window-based operations to ensure accurate interpretation of motion information. The coalescence block harmoniously integrates the contextual and motion features within a unified framework. Finally, the temporal decoder module discriminatively identifies the boundaries of the action sequence. This sequence of steps ensures the synergistic optimization of both CVFLM and TOFLM and thorough competent feature extraction for precise AR. Evaluations of CMCNet are carried out on publicly available datasets, InfAR and NTURGB-D, where superior performance is achieved. Our model yields the highest average precision of 89% and 85% on these datasets, respectively, representing an improvement of 2.25% (on InfAR) compared to conventional methods operating at spatial and optical flow levels which underscores its efficacy.",

Evaluations of CMCNet are carried out on publicly available datasets, InfAR and NTURGB-D, where superior performance is achieved. Our model yields the highest average precision of 89% and 85% on these datasets, respectively, representing an improvement of 2.25% (on InfAR) compared to conventional methods operating at spatial and optical flow levels which underscores its efficacy.",

Direct inspections and manual annotations are costly at scale, while conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. This study explores vision language models as a tool for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation. Although these models excel at describing common objects in human-centric images, their training sets may lack signals for esoteric built environment features, making their performance uncertain. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a vision language model and a visual prompting strategy that considers segmented image elements. Experiments on two urban features - stop lines and raised tables - show that while zero-shot prompting rarely works, the segmentation and visual prompting strategies achieve nearly 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results motivate further research in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at scale and in diverse environments.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting Origin-Destination (OD) flows is crucial for urban planning and transportation management. Traditional OD prediction models, while effective within single cities, often face limitations when applied across different cities due to varied traffic conditions, urban layouts, and socio-economic factors. In this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art learning-based methods in cross-city OD flow prediction.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent analysis of user generated content (UGC) plays an important role in ensuring urban natural gas safety and controlling process risks. However, most existing analysis methods are single-task driven and ignore the spatio-temporal information of gas sensing data. To address these problems, we propose a Transformer-based cyber-physical social security system (CPSS) for UGC analysis. Specifically, this unified system integrates multiple tasks, i.e. quality assessment and control of gas data, security factors of user consumption, and spatio-temporal abnormal gas signal detection. In the developed Transformer-based model, a time-space cross-attention module is embedded for combining the long-range spatio-temporal dependences of gas data. Moreover, a feature memory block module is introduced for abnormal feature enhancement and high-level representation of gas quality. Experimental results on related gas datasets demonstrate that this Transformer-based method achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the security system significantly improves the safety factor of natural gas use in smart cities, providing a robust framework for risk management and safety enhancement.",

Traffic congestion is a critical issue affecting urban mobility and efficiency in cities worldwide, with Bangalore no exception. This study addresses the challenge of leveraging advanced predictive analytics and intelligent transport systems to manage traffic congestion. The proposed research aims to address the limitations of traditional traffic management strategies by integrating the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model into an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) framework. The research employs rigorous data preprocessing techniques to leverage extensive data from multiple online map service providers and traffic monitoring platforms, spanning from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2023. The TFT model forecasts traffic congestion with notable precision, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.39, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.30, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.55, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.2%, and an R-squared (R²) value of 0.87. The outcomes obtained clearly illustrate the model’s superior accuracy and efficacy. Integrating TFT predictions into the ITS framework enhances real-time traffic control by improving the timings of traffic signals, recommending alternative routes, and improving incident management. This proactive approach significantly reduces traffic congestion and enhances travel efficiency, substantially advancing urban traffic management solutions.",

This study uses artificial intelligence to classify a new trend in European citizens’ search for sustainable destinations and to generate intelligent recommendations. Using data from the Flash Eurobarometer 499, we use a tree-based algorithm, random forest, to obtain intelligent citizens classification systems supported by machine learning. The classification system explores the predisposition of citizens to contribute to the three pillars of sustainability when choosing a destination to visit based on gender, age, and the region of living. We found that European citizens place little emphasis on the social sustainability pillar.

Traditional detectors are vulnerable to background noise, lighting changes, and similar objects (e.g., clouds, steam, dust), leading to high false alarm rates. Additionally, they struggle with detecting small objects, limiting their effectiveness in early fire warnings and rapid responses. As real-time monitoring demands grow, traditional methods often fall short in smart city and drone applications. To address these issues, we propose FireNet, integrating a simplified Vision Transformer (RepViT) to enhance global feature learning while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic snake convolution (DSConv) captures fine boundary details of flames and smoke, especially in complex curved edges.

    "abstract": "The integration of large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in urban environments requires careful consideration of network planning to ensure a reliable power supply and mitigate challenges. This study focuses on the impact of urban network planning such as wide solar-battery integration and demand response strategy on smart cities. Specifically, it investigates the effects of urban network planning on medium-voltage (MV) networks, with a case study conducted in Malaysia. The substation considered in the research consists of two parallel transformers, 13 lines, and 38 connection points. Each urban load connection point is equipped with 500 kW of solar PV capacity and 1 kWh of battery Energy Storage (BES) to store excess power generated from solar injecting it into the urban network during peak periods. The demand response strategy in this study mainly focuses on the Time of Use (ToU) strategy, encouraging customers to reduce usage during peak load periods and shift it to off-peak periods. Dynamic simulations using Power Factory software are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation techniques. The results indicate that each of the demand response and wide solar-battery integration strategies technique significantly improves the performance of the urban network by reducing voltage fluctuations and minimizing power losses. However, the study reveals that integrating these two techniques dramatically improves the system's performance.

    "contribution": "This study focuses on the impact of urban network planning such as wide solar-battery integration and demand response strategy on smart cities. Specifically, it investigates the effects of urban network planning on medium-voltage (MV) networks, with a case study conducted in Malaysia. The substation considered in the research consists of two parallel transformers, 13 lines, and 38 connection points. Each urban load connection point is equipped with 500 kW of solar PV capacity and 1 kWh of battery Energy Storage (BES) to store excess power generated from solar injecting it into the urban network during peak periods. The demand response strategy in this study mainly focuses on the Time of Use (ToU) strategy, encouraging customers to reduce usage during peak load periods and shift it to off-peak periods. Dynamic simulations using Power Factory software are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation techniques. The results indicate that each of the demand response and wide solar-battery integration strategies technique significantly improves the performance of the urban network by reducing voltage fluctuations and minimizing power losses. However, the study reveals that integrating these two techniques dramatically improves the system's performance. This study highlights the importance of incorporating urban network planning in smart cities. It enables reliable and efficient utilization of solar energy while maintaining grid stability.",

This work presents a novel hybrid deep learning model including components of the Improved-convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), Graph neural network (GNN), Transformer and Fusion Layer architectures for precise energy load forecasting. Better feature extraction results from the Improved-CNN's dilated convolution and residual block accommodation of wide receptive fields reduced the vanishing gradient problem. By capturing temporal links in both directions, Bi-LSTM networks help to better grasp complicated energy use patterns. Graph neural networks improve predictive capacities across linked systems by characterizing the spatial relationships between energy-consuming units in smart cities. Emphasizing critical trends to guarantee reliable forecasts, transformer models use attention methods to manage long-term dependencies in energy consumption data. Combining CNN, Bi-LSTM, Transformer and GNN component predictions in a Fusion Layer synthesizes numerous data representations to increase accuracy. With Root Mean Square Error of 5.7532 Wh, Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 3.5001%, Mean Absolute Error of 6.7532 Wh and R2 of 0.9701, the hybrid model fared better than other models on the ‘Electric Power Consumption’ Kaggle dataset.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an evolving paradigm that has dramatically transformed the traditional style of living into a smart lifestyle. IoT devices have recently attained great attention due to their wide range of applications in various sectors, such as healthcare, smart home devices, smart industries, smart cities, and so forth. However, security is still a challenging issue in the IoT environment. Because of the disparate nature of IoT devices, it is hard to detect the different kinds of attacks available in IoT. Various existing works aim to provide a reliable intrusion detection system (IDS) technique. But they failed to work because of several security issues. Thus, the proposed study presents a blockchain-based deep learning model for IDS. Initially, the input data are preprocessed using min-max normalization, converting the raw input data into improved quality. In order to detect the presented attacks in the provided dataset, the proposed work introduced Gaussian mixture–fully convolutional variational autoencoder (GM-FCVAE) model. The implementation is performed in Python, and the performance of the proposed GM-FCVAE model is analyzed by evaluating several metrics. The proposed GM-FCVAE model is tested on three datasets and attained superior accuracy of 99.18%, 98.81%, and 98.4% with UNSW-NB15, CICIDS 2019, and N_BaIoT datasets, respectively. The comparison reveals that the proposed GM-FCVAE model obtained higher results than the other deep learning techniques. The outperformance shows the efficacy of the proposed study in identifying security attacks.",

    "abstract": "Weapon detection is the process of identifying handheld weapons such as guns, knives, etc., and creating a bounding box around them to highlight the spatial locations. Weapon detection is one of the key building blocks of the intelligent video surveillance system for security applications in smart cities. However, detecting handheld weapons from surveillance videos is quite challenging due to small object size, occlusion, illumination variation, model complexity, and latency. Hence, an efficient, novel, robust, and lightweight YOLOv8-based weapon detector with GhostNet backbone and C3 module with transformer block (C3TR) neck (YOLO-GTWDNet model) is proposed for detecting the weapons either from stored images or from the live video streams. The proposed model is trained using a weapon dataset named “Weapon7,” which is developed by collecting various weapon classes, such as Axe, Bow and arrow, Gun, Knife, Lathi, Pistol, and Sword, from various publicly available datasets, Internet, and own camera capture. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed YOLO-GTWDNet model. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models when compared using both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. The deployment of the proposed model is expected to bolster public safety significantly, providing city authorities with a powerful tool to mitigate risks and swiftly address potential threats.",

Adequate data is usually a prerequisite for existing machine learning methods, especially most deep learning models. However, many cities still suffer from the data scarcity issue due to the unbalanced city development levels. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel cross-city fine-grained urban flow inference model named FGITrans, which aims to effectively transfer the knowledge from the data-rich cities to the data-scarce cities. Specifically, we design a weight-sharing triple-branch transformer framework which adopts self-attention and cross-attention for source/target city feature learning and domain alignment, respectively. Then, we propose a novel spatio-temporal adaptive embedding (STAE) layer for our transformer framework, and introduce a cross-city knowledge distillation (CKD) loss to narrow the cross-city disparities. The CKD loss explicitly enforces the framework to learn the discriminative domain-specific and domain-invariant representations simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on four large real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of FGITrans compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

Existing approaches mostly rely on a large number of high quality urban flow data, but neglect the data sparsity issue which is common in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the performance of existing methods may not be promising towards cities that lack sufficient traffic flow data. How to design a more generalizable urban flow inference model that is able to effectively transfer knowledge across multiple cities is challenging and remains as an open research problem. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained urban flow inference model named AdaTM, which leverages the city-specific and city-invariant knowledge extracted from multiple cities. Specifically, we first propose a transformer-based urban feature extraction network named UBFormer to comprehensively extract the spatial-temporal features of multiple source cities. Then, we incorporate a learnable integrator to fuse the city-invariant and city-specific feature representations for the target city with sparse traffic flow data. Finally, we construct the feature representation of the target city through adaptive feature fusion and infer its fine-grained urban flows through the designed urban flow upsampler. Extensive experiments conducted on four large real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SAMPLENET, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SAMPLENET. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SAMPLENET. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.",

The precision in forecasting spatial and temporal patterns holds significant potential for optimizing resource allocation, land utilization, and infrastructure development. While existing review and survey papers predominantly focus on specific forecasting domains such as intelligent transportation, urban planning, pandemics, disease prediction, climate and weather forecasting, environmental data prediction, and agricultural yield projection, limited attention has been devoted to comprehensive surveys encompassing multiple objects concurrently.

By accurately predicting future outcomes, the ability to strategize, preemptively address risks, and minimize their potential impact is enhanced. The precision in forecasting spatial and temporal patterns holds significant potential for optimizing resource allocation, land utilization, and infrastructure development. While existing review and survey papers predominantly focus on specific forecasting domains such as intelligent transportation, urban planning, pandemics, disease prediction, climate and weather forecasting, environmental data prediction, and agricultural yield projection, limited attention has been devoted to comprehensive surveys encompassing multiple objects concurrently.",

    "abstract": "Automatic road interpretation using remote sensing images is crucial for intelligent city construction and is widely applied in various domains such as automatic driving navigation, cartography, and urban planning. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have been utilized with large-scale remote sensing datasets to extract abundant semantic features, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of road extraction. However, these models ignore the correlation between multiscale local context and global semantics, which could cause fragmentary prediction in complex remote sensing environments. In addition, the edge features of roads often cannot be accurately constructed due to the lack of semantic guidance. To address the aforementioned issues, this study developed a hybrid deep neural network integrating CNN and Transformer structures. In the encoder, a multiscale global attention pyramid (MGAP) is constructed to enhance the overall semantic representation of the road with a local context. The road edge perceptron is designed in the decoder to improve edge prediction accuracy by establishing hierarchical spatial attention. Quantitative experiments and visual analysis on two public road datasets have confirmed that the proposed network architecture and modules can improve road extraction accuracy with high efficiency (achieving an average 71% IOU and 83% F1 score).",

    "abstract": "The advancement to Urban 4.0 requires urban digitization and predictive maintenance of infrastructure to improve efficiency, durability, and quality of life. This study aims to integrate intelligent technologies for the predictive maintenance of photovoltaic panel systems, which serve as essential smart city renewable energy sources. In addition, we employ vision transformers (ViT), a deep learning architecture devoted to evolving image analysis, to detect anomalies in PV systems. The ViT model is pre-trained on ImageNet to exploit a comprehensive set of relevant visual features from the PV images and classify the input PV panel. Furthermore, the developed system was integrated into a web application that allows users to upload PV images, automatically detect anomalies, and provide detailed panel information, such as PV panel type, defect probability, and anomaly status. A comparative study using several convolutional neural network architectures (VGG, ResNet, and AlexNet) and the ViT transformer was conducted. Therefore, the adopted ViT model performs excellently in anomaly detection, where the ViT achieves an AUC of 0.96. Finally, the proposed approach excels at the prompt identification of potential defects detection, reducing maintenance costs, advancing equipment lifetime, and optimizing PV system implementation.",

    "abstract": "Person and vehicle re-identification has been a popular subject in the field of the computer vision technologies. Existing closed-set re-identification surpasses human-level accuracies on commonly used benchmarks, and the research focus for re-identification is shifting to the open world-setting. The latter setting is more suitable for practical applications, however, is less developed due to its challenges. On the other hand, existing research is more focused on person re-identification, even though both, person and vehicle, are important components for smart city applications. This review attempts to combine for the first time the problem of person and vehicle re-identification under closed and open settings, its challenges, and the existing research. Specifically, we start from the origin of the re-identification task and then summarize state-of-the-art research based on deep learning in different scenarios: person or vehicle or unified re-identification in closed- and open-world settings. Additionally, we analyse a new method for solving the re-identification task using the Transformer, a model architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism, which shows promising results. This survey facilitates future research by providing a summary on past and present trends, and aids to improve the usability of re-ID techniques.",

The study comprehensively evaluates deep learning models, such as RNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, GRU, Transformer, and MLP, using a ten-year dataset from the esteemed Smart Road Accident Database in Hubballi-Dharwad. The findings unequivocally underscore LSTM's superiority, exhibiting lower errors in both yearly (RMSE: 0.291, MAE: 0.271, MAPE: 6.674%) and monthly (RMSE: 0.186, MAE: 0.176, MAPE: 5.850%) variations. Based on these compelling findings, the study provides strategic recommendations to urban development authorities, emphasizing comprehensive policy frameworks encompassing short-term and long-term measures to reduce accident rates alongside meticulous safety measures and infrastructure planning.

    "abstract": "One of the crucial issues for power grids in strengthening the urbanization around the world is imbalance between supply and demand, which leads the users to consume electricity in an anomalous manner without paying for it. Electricity theft plays a pivotal role in cutting down on the electricity bills. The existing data-oriented approaches for electricity theft detection (ETD) in the smart cities have limited ability to handle noisy high-dimensional data and features’ associations. These limitations raise the misclassification rate, which makes some of the approaches unacceptable for electric utilities. A new twofold end-to-end methodology is proposed for ETD. In the first fold, it groups the similar electricity consumption (EC) cases through grey wolf optimization (GWO)-based clustering mechanism; clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP), we named it GC. In the second fold, a new relational stacked denoising autoencoder (RSDAE)-based semi-supervised generative adversarial network (GAN), termed as RGAN, is used for ETD. The combined methodology is named as GC-RGAN. In the methodology, RSDAE acts as both feature extraction technique and generator sub-model of the proposed RGAN. The proposed methodology utilizes the advantages of clustering, adversarial learning and semi-supervised EC data. Besides, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, extensive simulations are performed using smart meter data. Simulation results validate the excellent ETD performance of the proposed GC-RGAN against existing ETD schemes, such as random forest and semi-supervised support vector machine. In comparison, GC-RGAN covers the ETD score of 98% that shows its suitability for real-world scenarios. The proposed solution has extraordinary performance for ETD as compared to traditional solutions, which shows its superiority and usefulness for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Cybercriminals have become an imperative threat because they target the most valuable resource on earth, data. Organizations prepare against cyber attacks by creating Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) that use various technologies to monitor and detect threats and to help perform forensics on machines and networks. Testing the limits of defense technologies and the skill of a CSIRT can be performed through adversary emulation performed by so-called “red teams”. The red team’s work is primarily manual and requires high skill. We propose SpecRep, a system to ease the testing of the detection capabilities of defenses in complex, heterogeneous infrastructures. SpecRep uses previously known attack specifications to construct attack scenarios based on attacker objectives instead of the traditional attack graphs or a list of actions. We create a metalanguage to describe objectives to be achieved in an attack together with a compiler that can build multiple attack scenarios that achieve the objectives. We use text processing tools aided by large language models to extract information from freely available white papers and convert them to plausible attack specifications that can then be emulated by SpecRep. We show how our system can emulate attacks against a smart home, a large enterprise, and an industrial control system.",

Organizations prepare against cyber attacks by creating Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) that use various technologies to monitor and detect threats and to help perform forensics on machines and networks. Testing the limits of defense technologies and the skill of a CSIRT can be performed through adversary emulation performed by so-called “red teams”. The red team’s work is primarily manual and requires high skill.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of India's smart cities, precise meter readings are essential for effectively managing domestic energy and water systems. Nevertheless, meter reading employing conventional techniques prove to be both costly and time-consuming, especially considering the vast user base and deficit of everyday consumption analysis. To cope with this challenge, the proposed solution introduces a novel unified wireless smart metering system for measuring energy and water usage. This prototype harnesses the smart, advanced metering technology to manage energy and water resources. The presence of data and remote control capabilities in smart distribution transformers offers distribution operators the chance to optimize system operation and control. The innovative system proposed utilizes smart metering technology and incorporates a distribution system self-healing mechanism against power outages, revolutionizing the way utilities manage water and energy consumption. The system not only offers real-time consumption statistics to the utility provider but also provides the flexibility to remotely control the system's turn-on and turn-off functions. The system effectively captures real-time data, transmits it via LoRa to Telegram application. The system automatically re-establishes remote connections in the event of disconnections caused by emergency conditions or non-payment of the bill, once the relevant issue has been resolved. Additionally, the system promptly notifies authorities on overload, over-temperature, and instances of electricity theft. The system proficiently generates bills based on the consumed data and seamlessly transmits the consumed units to the authorities. The innovative system proposed has proven its ability to communicate effectively, yielding results that align with the given circumstances.",

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. In certain cases, it becomes challenging to collect any labeled data from downstream scenarios, intensifying the problem further. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model that can exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UrbanGPT.",

    "abstract": "Accurate power load forecasting is critical to achieving the sustainability of energy management systems. However, conventional prediction methods suffer from low precision and stability because of crude modules for predicting short-term and medium-term loads. To solve such a problem, a Combined Modeling Power Load-Forecasting (CMPLF) method is proposed in this work. The CMPLF comprises two modules to deal with short-term and medium-term load forecasting, respectively. Each module consists of four essential parts including initial forecasting, decomposition and denoising, nonlinear optimization, and evaluation. Especially, to break through bottlenecks in hierarchical model optimization, we effectively fuse the Nonlinear Autoregressive model with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks into the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The experiment results based on real-world datasets from Queensland and China mainland show that our CMPLF has significant performance superiority compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. CMPLF achieves a goodness-of-fit value of 97.174% in short-term load prediction and 97.162% in medium-term prediction. Our approach will be of great significance in promoting the sustainable development of smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Designing effective cybersecurity visualization has become a crucial component of cyber defense strategies in many domains and industrial environments. Human behaviour, modeling and input are major aspects of designing visualization systems. Yet, the task of evaluating these developed visualization systems is both time-consuming and challenging, and it is often prone to cases where user evaluation is limited owing to a lack of different stakeholders and end users during the design process. Recognizing the potential of advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), our study aims to explore their capabilities in evaluating web-based security visualization tools and dashboards, particularly in the context of smart cities and buildings. We study and compare the feasibility of using various LLMs available today, for conducting usability testing, serving as an additional resource given the limited availability of human participants. In particular, we focus on three different LLMs: Bing Chat, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o. While each had its strengths and drawbacks, our findings revealed that the results obtained had a strong correlation with human test subjects. LLMs can be a valuable aid during evaluation, by offering in-depth insights and evaluations, tailored to the specific requirements of smart buildings, cities and automation cybersecurity. Moreover, our research and findings also reveal that LLMs can similarly be used for the evaluation of a wide range of other visual systems for industrial environments.",

    "abstract": "As cities transform, disrupting citizens' lives, their participation in urban development is often undervalued despite its importance. Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes. The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources. The results show that contextual feedback performed better overall, with significant improvements in the pragmatic and hedonic quality, attractiveness, reuse intention, feeling that the complaint is taken seriously, and the citizens' trust in their municipality.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds is crucial for advancing smart city infrastructure and supporting autonomous driving technology. However, existing semantic segmentation techniques designed for indoor environments often struggle to adapt to vast outdoor scenes. Moreover, networks for large-scale scenes face challenges such as limited receptive fields and computational complexity, hindering their ability to accurately perceive small target features. To address these challenges, we propose PVCFormer, a novel cross-attention architecture that leverages both point and voxel representations. By feeding concurrently sampled data at varying voxel resolutions into the network, PVCFormer enhances the segmentation of small-scale features while expanding the receptive field. Additionally, the cross-transformer block facilitates better fusion of point and voxel features, and the introduction of CosFormer improves the computational efficiency of the network.Simultaneously, we introduce SYSU9, a new dataset labeled with 9 categories covering an area of over 7 square kilometers, to serve as a benchmark for evaluating point cloud semantic segmentation algorithms. We proposed two model versions, PVCFormer-CA and PVCFormer-SA. PVCFormer-CA achieves an overall accuracy of 92.4 % on SensatUrban, 94.6 % on DALES, and 91.1 % on SYSU9. For semantic segmentation, PVCFormer-CA achieves 61.5 % mIoU on SensatUrban, 73.6 % mIoU on DALES, and 62.4 % mIoU on SYSU9.Our experiments demonstrated promising results in large-scale outdoor point cloud semantic segmentation and introduce novel methodologies leveraging attention mechanisms for handling large-scale point clouds.",

In our study, we use a hybrid framework, the Travel Demand Conditioning Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN), which combines data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches to address the issue of traffic trajectory generation.

In the domain of visible and infrared image fusion, object vanishment after fusion is a key problem which restricts the fusion performance. To address this problem, a novel Salient Regional Generative Adversarial Network GAN (SaReGAN) is presented for infrared and VIS image fusion. The SaReGAN consists of three parts. In the first part, the salient regions of infrared image are extracted by visual saliency map and the information of these regions is preserved. In the second part, the VIS image, infrared image and salient information are merged thoroughly in the generator to gain a pre-fused image. In the third part, the discriminator attempts to differentiate the pre-fused image and VIS image, in order to learn details from VIS image based on the adversarial mechanism. Experimental results verify that the SaReGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

Most of these projects incorporate AI tools or algorithms, such as the combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) with AI to form AIoT, or the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). The objective is to leverage the latest technological developments to achieve a smarter Taipei. This study analyzes the execution of 302 PoC projects, categorizing them into 22 technological segments that together form an AI framework for smart city construction applications. This framework corresponds to 15 major issues of concern to Taipei’s residents, with the potential to address or mitigate 13 of them. According to the IMD Smart City Index Report 2023, Taipei’s smart city rating improved from a B in 2021 to an A in 2023, indicating progress. The results demonstrate that the AI framework derived from dissecting multiple PoC projects can effectively enhance the city’s smart construction ratings. This framework, aligned with major municipal concerns, proposes solutions driven by AI, guiding Taipei’s digital transformation into a smarter city and enabling its citizens to enjoy an improved quality of life.",

This study examines intelligent AI models and applications in healthcare settings, with a focus on assessing impacts on marginalized and disadvantaged populations. Comprehensive scholarly database searches identified 45 relevant studies investigating issues on algorithmic bias, lack of diverse training data, and discrimination risks linked to healthcare AI systems. The review finds most applications still lack adequate safeguards to prevent discrimination against vulnerable populations. Through the review of these systems, we propose an integrated inclusive smart health model that considers both technical interventions as well as broader participatory and ethical approaches. Realizing AI’s fullest potential to meaningfully advance health justice requires not only algorithmic adjustments to mitigate bias, and efforts to improve diversity of training data, transparent analysis frameworks, and best practices for ensuring just AI systems in healthcare, but also a human-centered commitment to thoughtful, inclusive development approaches that center the needs and priorities of communities impacted by health disparities from the outset.",

    "abstract": "Building extraction is one of the important research directions that has attracted great attention in the field of remote sensing image processing. It refers to the process of accurately extracting building information such as the location and shape of buildings by analyzing and processing remote sensing images. This technology plays an irreplaceable and important role in urban planning, disaster management, map production, smart city construction, and other fields. In recent years, with the advancement of science and technology, especially the continuous evolution of earth observation technology and the rapid development of deep learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become an emerging solution for extracting buildings from remote sensing images because of their powerful feature extraction capability. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview and analysis of building extraction methods based on convolutional neural networks. We conduct a comprehensive literature review to summarize the building extraction methods from perspectives of model structure, multi-scale feature differences, lack of boundary information, and model complexity. This will help researchers to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and the applicable scenarios. In addition, several typical building datasets in this field are described in detail, as well as the potential issues associated with these datasets. Subsequently, by collecting experimental results of relevant algorithms on these typical datasets, a detailed discussion on the accuracy and parameter quantities of various methods is conducted, aiming to provide a comprehensive assessment of performance and applicability of these methods. Finally, based on the current research status of this field and looking forward to the new era of high-quality development in artificial intelligence, the future directions for building extraction are prospected. Specifically, this paper discusses the combination of Transformers and CNNs, the combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning, multi-modal data fusion, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods, real-time extraction based on large-scale remote sensing model, building instance segmentation, and building contour vector extraction. In conclusion, our review can provide some valuable references and inspirations for future related research, so as to promote the practical application and innovation of building extraction from remote sensing images. This will fulfill the demand for efficient and precise map information in remote sensing technology and other related fields, contributing to the sustainable and high-quality development of human society.",

    "abstract": "With the artificial intelligence technology development boom, large language models are demonstrating their potential in comprehension and creativity. Large language models such as GPT-4 and Gemini have been able to powerfully study for various professional-level exams. However, as a language model itself, its powerful comprehension can only be reflected in text sequences. Currently, although videos can be generated through the connection between 3D point clouds and large language models, there is currently no prompt project that directly interacts with one-dimensional through attribute calculation results. The point cloud data is also rich in information that can support various tasks of urban construction. For scene-level point cloud data, there has been a lot of research done on semantic segmentation, target detection, and other tasks. However, it is usually difficult to provide direct help to scene construction from the perception results. This paper presents a method for applying large language models to urban ecological construction by combining the results of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. The objective is to integrate the prior knowledge and creative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within urban development with the outcomes derived from point cloud semantic segmentation results. This integration aims to establish an interactive point cloud intelligent analysis system, tailored for aiding decision-making processes in urban ecological civilization construction, thus presenting innovative perspectives for the advancement of smart city development.",

    "abstract": "Integrating Embodied Robots into a smart city's networked system can significantly enhance the city's operational efficiency. These robots can be connected to the city's network, receiving and transmitting data in real time for enhancing human–robot communications. Language-conditioned robot behavior plays a vital role in executing complex tasks by associating human commands or instructions with perception and actions. However, most language-conditioned policy-related research is limited to specific datasets and cannot generalize across different environments. In this study, we propose a novel imitation learning framework tailored for language-conditioned robotic tasks. Our framework includes specialized encoders designed for various benchmarks and utilizes two distinct models: the Transformer and Diffusion models. We rigorously evaluate this framework in three different robotic environments. Our findings indicate that the framework consistently delivers superior performance across multiple domains. Notably, we observe that the Transformer model is particularly effective in managing tasks with long trajectories, whereas the Diffusion model demonstrates enhanced proficiency in generating trajectories from limited training datasets. Our approach showcases remarkable generalization capabilities across a range of tasks and achieves significantly higher success rates in task completion.",

The location big data obtained from human activities, which is cohesive with urban functions, provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, as urban functions become highly mixed, existing feature representation structures struggle to explicitly depict the latent human activity features, limiting their applicability for detecting mixed urban functions in a supervised manner. To close the gap, this study analogizes the latent human activity features to the shape, texture, and color semantics of images, with a contrastive learning framework being introduced to extract image-based crowd mobility features for detecting mixed urban functions. Firstly, by translating human activity features into image semantics, a novel feature representation structure termed the Trajectory Temporal Image (TTI) is proposed to explicitly represent human activity features. Secondly, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model is employed to extract image-based semantics in a self-supervised manner. Lastly, based on urban dynamics, a mathematical model is developed to represent mixed urban functions, and the decomposition of mixed urban functions is achieved using the theory of fuzzy sets. A case study is conducted using taxi trajectory data in three cities in China. Experimental results indicate the high discriminability of our proposed method, especially in areas with weak activity intensity, and reveal the relationship between the mixture index and the trip distance. The proposed method is promising to establish a solid scientific foundation for comprehending the urban complex system.",

    "abstract": "Point of Interest (POI) is an important intermediary connecting geo data and text data in smart cities, widely used to extract and identify urban functional areas. While computer uses numerical coordinates, human uses places names or addresses to find location, leading to spatial-semantic ambiguities. However, traditional methods of extracting POIs are time-consuming and costly, and has the limitation of the lack of integration of functionalities such as information extraction(IE), information searching. Also, previous models have low accessibility and high barriers for users. With the advent of Large Language Models(LLMs) we propose a method that connects LLM models and POI information based on social media text data. By employing two steps, named entities recognition(NER) and POI information searching, we introduce POI GPT, the specialized model for providing precise location of POIs in social media text data. We compared its results with those obtained by human experts, NER model and zero-shot prompts. The findings show that our model effectively found the POI and precise location from social media text data. In result, POI GPT is a effective model that solves the existing POI extraction problems. We provide new extraction technique of POI GPT which is a new paradigm in traditional urban research methodologies and be actively utilized in urban studies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Smart cities have emerged as a promising solution to the problems associated with urbanization. However, research that holistically considers diverse stakeholders in smart cities is scarce. This study utilizes data from four types of collaborators (academia, public sector, industry, and civil society actors) to identify key topics and suggest research areas for developing smart cities. We used latent Dirichlet allocation and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for topic extraction and analysis. The analysis reveals that sustainability and digital platform have received similar levels of interest from academia, industry, and government, whereas governance, resource, and green space are less frequently mentioned than technology-related topics. Hype cycle analysis, which considers public and media expectations, reveals that smart cities experienced rapid growth from 2015 to 2021, but the growth rate has slowed since 2022. This means that a breakthrough improvement in the current situation is required. Accordingly, we propose resolving the unbalanced distribution of topic interests among collaborators, especially in the areas of governance, environment, economy, and healthcare. We expect that our findings will help researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders in understanding which topics are underdeveloped in their fields and taking active measures for the future development of smart cities.",

    "abstract": "With the tremendous success of large language models such as ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has entered a new era of large models. Multimodal data, which can comprehensively perceive and recognize the physical world, has become an essential path towards general artificial intelligence. However, multimodal large models trained on public datasets often underperform in specific industrial domains. In this paper, we tackle the problem of building large vision-language intelligent models for specific industrial domains by leveraging the general large models and federated learning. We compare the challenges faced by federated learning in the era of small models and large models from different dimensions, and propose a technical framework for federated learning in the era of large models.Specifically, our framework mainly considers three aspects: heterogeneous model fusion, flexible aggregation methods, and data quality improvement. Based on this framework, we conduct a case study of leading enterprises contributing vision-language data and expert knowledge to city safety operation management. The preliminary experiments show that enterprises can enhance and accumulate their intelligence capabilities through federated learning, and jointly create an intelligent city model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy infrastructure security, residential community security and urban operation management.",

    "abstract": "ChatGPT plays significant roles in the third decade of the 21st Century. Smart cities applications can be integrated with ChatGPT in various fields. This research proposes an approach for developing large language models using generative artificial intelligence models suitable for small- and medium-sized enterprises with limited hardware resources. There are many generative AI systems in operation and in development. However, the technological, human, and financial resources required to develop generative AI systems are impractical for small- and medium-sized enterprises. In this study, we present a proposed approach to reduce training time and computational cost that is designed to automate question–response interactions for specific domains in smart cities. The proposed model utilises the BLOOM approach as its backbone for using generative AI to maximum the effectiveness of small- and medium-sized enterprises. We have conducted a set of experiments on several datasets associated with specific domains to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Experiments using datasets for the English and Vietnamese languages have been combined with model training using low-rank adaptation to reduce training time and computational cost. In comparative experimental testing, the proposed model outperformed the ‘Phoenix’ multilingual chatbot model by achieving a 92% performance compared to ‘ChatGPT’ for the English benchmark.",

    "abstract": "A crucial natural resource that directly affects the ecology is forests. Forest fires have become a noteworthy problem recently as a result of both natural and man-made climatic changes. A smart city application that uses a forest fire discovery technology based on artificial intelligence is provided in order to prevent significant catastrophes. A major danger to the environment, animals, and human lives is posed by forest fires. The early detection and suppression of these fires is crucial. This work offers a thorough method for detecting forest fires using advanced deep learning (DL) algorithms. Preprocessing the forest fire dataset is the initial step in order to improve its relevance and quality. Then, to enable the model to capture the dynamic character of forest fire data, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used to extract useful feature from the dataset. In this work, weight optimisation in LSTM is performed using a Modified Firefly Algorithm (MFFA), which enhances the model's performance and convergence. The Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Networks (VAEGAN) model is used to classify the retrieved features. Furthermore, every DL model's success depends heavily on hyperparameter optimisation. The hyperparameters of an VAEGAN model are tuned in this research using the Waterwheel Plant Optimisation Algorithm (WWPA), an optimisation technique inspired by nature. WPPA uses the idea of plant growth to properly tune the VAEGAN's parameters, assuring the network's peak fire detection performance. The outstanding accuracy (ACC) of 97.8%, precision (PR) of 97.7%, recall (RC) of 96.26%, F1-score (F1) of 97.3%, and specificity (SPEC) of 97.5% of the suggested model beats all other existing models, which is probably owing to its improved architecture and training techniques.",

    "abstract": "Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have emerged as an increasingly important form of transportation in smart cities, playing a pivotal role in the evolving landscape of urban mobility. As cities worldwide strive to promote sustainable and efficient transportation options, BSS offer a flexible, eco-friendly alternative that complements traditional public transport systems. These systems, however, are complex and influenced by a myriad of endogenous and exogenous factors. This complexity poses challenges in predicting BSS activity and optimizing its usage and effectiveness. This study delves into the dynamics of the BSS in Hamburg, Germany, focusing on system stability and activity prediction. We propose an interpretable attention-based Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The proposed TFT model outperforms the LSTM model with a 36.8% improvement in RMSE and overcomes current black-box models via interpretability. Via detailed analysis, key factors influencing bike-sharing activity, especially in terms of temporal and spatial contexts, are identified, examined, and evaluated. Based on the results, we propose interventions and a deployed TFT model that can improve the effectiveness of BSS. This research contributes to the evolving field of sustainable urban mobility via data analysis for data-informed decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction is essential for smart city management and planning, aiding in optimizing traffic scheduling and improving overall traffic conditions. However, due to the correlation and heterogeneity of traffic data, effectively integrating the captured temporal and spatial features remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a model spatial–temporal fusion gated transformer network (STFGTN), which is based on an attention mechanism that integrates temporal and spatial features. This paper proposes an attention mechanism-based model to address these issues and model complex spatial–temporal dependencies in road networks. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to achieve long-term dependency modeling and global representation of time series data. Regarding temporal features, we incorporate a time embedding layer and a time transformer to learn temporal dependencies. This capability contributes to a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of spatial–temporal dynamic patterns throughout the entire time series. As for spatial features, we utilize DGCN and spatial transformers to capture both global and local spatial dependencies, respectively. Additionally, we propose two fusion gate mechanisms to effectively accommodate to the complex correlation and heterogeneity of spatial–temporal information, resulting in a more accurate reflection of the actual traffic flow. Our experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the superior performance of our approach.",

The complexity and heterogeneity of smart cities have become vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks, especially privacy-related attacks such as inference and data poisoning ones. Federated Learning (FL) has been regarded as a hopeful method to enable distributed learning with privacy-preserved intelligence in IoT applications. Even though the significance of developing privacy-preserving FL has drawn as a great research interest, the current research only concentrates on FL with independent identically distributed (i.i.d) data and few studies have addressed the non-i. i.d setting. FL is known to be vulnerable to Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) attacks, where an adversary can presume to act as a contributor participating in the training process to acquire the private data of other contributors. This paper proposes an innovative Privacy Protection-based Federated Deep Learning (PP-FDL) framework, which accomplishes data protection against privacy-related GAN attacks, along with high classification rates from non-i. i.d data. PP-FDL is designed to enable fog nodes to cooperate to train the FDL model in a way that ensures contributors have no access to the data of each other, where class probabilities are protected utilizing a private identifier generated for each class. The PP-FDL framework is evaluated for image classification using simple convolutional networks which are trained using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The empirical results have revealed that PF-DFL can achieve data protection and the framework outperforms the other three state-of-the-art models with 3%–8% as accuracy improvements.",

    "abstract": "Security in smart cities is a challenging issue in urban environments as they depend upon interconnected technologies and data for effective services. To address security challenges, smart cities implement robust cybersecurity measures, including network monitoring, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. Detecting and mitigating possible security risks in drone network B5G is a crucial aspect of ensuring reliable and safe drone operation. It is necessary to establish sophisticated and robust attack detection techniques to defend against security threats as the use of drones becomes increasingly widespread and their applications diversify. This is due to the lack of privacy and security consideration in the drone's system, including an inadequate computation capability and unsecured wireless channels to perform advanced cryptographic algorithms. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detection systems can identify suspicious activities and monitor network traffic, such as anomalous communication patterns or unauthorized access attempts. Therefore, the study presents an enhanced dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm with deep learning-based attack detection (EDMOA-DLAD) in Networks B5G for the purpose of Drones technique. The presented EDMOA-DLAD technique aims to recognize the attacks and classifies them on the drone network B5G. Primarily, the EDMOA-DLAD technique designs a feature selection (FS) approach using EDMOA. To detect attacks, the EDMOA-DLAD technique uses a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) classifier. Finally, the EDMOA-DLAD technique applies the beetle antenna search (BAS) technique for the optimum hyperparameter part of DVAE model. The outcome of EDMOA-DLAD approach can be verified on benchmark datasets. A wide range of simulations inferred that the EDMOA-DLAD method obtains enhanced performance of 99.79% over other classification techniques.",

    "abstract": "In the subjective evaluation process, the hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), as a convenient and robust presentation tool, cannot only suitably address the decision makers’ (DMs’) or experts’ hesitant and uncertain issues but also can arise the dimension curse puzzle. Furthermore, the decision-making result is just derived according to the given objective and subjective information, without considering the DM's subjective evaluation and the environment's dynamic influence. Unlike the previous studies, this paper tries to address them from the deep learning viewpoint. To this end, we first define the non-equidimensional HFS (NHFS) and then introduce the equidimensional and classification characters into the NHFS to further develop the equidimensional HFS (EHFS) and the EHFS with the optimal classification result. Then, the equidimensional hesitant fuzzy-generative adversarial network (EHF-GAN) model is proposed to transform the hesitant fuzzy information from the non-equidimensional to the equidimensional form. The generalization and the convergence of the new model are proven to show the models’ reasonability. In addition, the double-learning algorithm of the EHF-GAN model is designed, which can fuse the DMs’ dynamic judgments and derive the optimal decision-making results. Lastly, this paper applies the proposed model and algorithm to an illustrative example of the new smart city enterprises and then shows their feasibility and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Given the pervasive use of deep learning models across various domains, ensuring model security has emerged as a critical concern. This paper examines backdoor attacks, a form of security threat that compromises model output by poisoning the training data. Our investigation specifically addresses backdoor attacks on object detection models, vital for security-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and smart city systems. Consequently, such attacks on object detection models could pose significant risks to human life and property. Consequently, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose serious threats to human life and property. To elucidate this security risk, we propose and experimentally evaluate five backdoor attack methods for object detection models. The key findings are: (1) Unnecessary Object Generation: a globally embedded trigger creating false objects in the target class; (2) Partial Misclassification: a trigger causing specific class misclassification; (3) Global Misclassification: a trigger reclassifying all objects into the target class; (4) Specific Object Vanishing: a trigger causing non-detection of certain objects; (5) Object Position Shifting: a trigger causing bounding box shifts for a specific class. To assess attack effectiveness, we introduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR), which can surpass 1 in object detection tasks, thus providing a more accurate reflection of the attack impact. Experimental outcomes indicate that the ASR values of these varied backdoor attacks frequently approach or surpass 1, demonstrating our method's capacity to impact multiple objects simultaneously. Additionally, to augment trigger stealth, we introduce Backdoor Attack with Wavelet Embedding (BAWE), which discreetly embeds triggers as image watermarks in training data. This embedding method yields more natural triggers with enhanced stealth. Highly stealthy triggers are less detectable, significantly increasing the likelihood of attack success and efficacy. We have developed a Transformer-based network architecture, diverging from traditional neural network frameworks. Our experiments across various object detection datasets highlight the susceptibility of these models and the high success rate of our approaches. This vulnerability poses significant risks to digital twin systems utilizing object detection technology. Our methodology not only enhances trigger stealth but also suits dense predictive tasks and circumvents current neural network backdoor attack detection methods. The experimental findings expose key challenges in the security of object detection models, particularly when integrated with digital twins, offering new avenues for backdoor attack research and foundational insights for devising defense strategies against these attacks.",

    "abstract": "As a fundamental spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, traffic prediction is pivotal in transportation management and urban computing. Nonetheless, the intricate and dynamic nature of spatiotemporal correlations presents significant obstacles in acquiring precise forecasts. Existing techniques utilize graph convolutional networks in conjunction with temporal modules, such as recurrent neural networks or transformer-based structures, to effectively extract spatiotemporal features. Unfortunately, current approaches struggle with outliers and fail to capture potential global correlations between different timestamps. In this study, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network with Embedded location and time features (STEGCN) for traffic prediction problems, which can generate precise and prompt predictions. STEGCN effectively captures the complex interdependencies among location, time, and traffic volume by leveraging the TransD algorithm to embed their representations. For each timestamp, a graph convolution module is exploited to capture the spatial features, merged with the embeddings of location and time that serve as global external information. Then, we leverage a temporal module composed of 1-D convolutions to capture the spatiotemporal patterns. The traffic volume embedding is employed to constrain predictions within a reasonable range. Extensive experiments and rigorous analysis show that our STEGCN model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating exceptional performance and potential for practical application.",

    "abstract": "Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that enables large-scale smart city applications, such as environmental sensing and traffic monitoring. However, traditional MCS often suffers from performance degradation due to the limited spatiotemporal coverage of collected data. In this context, Sparse MCS has been proposed, which utilizes data inference algorithms to recover full data from sparse data collected by users. However, existing Sparse MCS approaches often overlook spatiotemporal fractures, where no data is observed either for a sensing subarea across all sensing time slots (temporal fracture), or for a sensing time slot in all sensing subarea (spatial fracture). Such spatiotemporal fractures pose great challenges to the data inference algorithms, as it is difficult to capture the complex spatiotemporal correlations of the sensing data from very limited observations. To address this issue, we propose a Graph- and Attention-based Matrix Completion (GAMC) method for the spatiotemporal fracture data inference problem in Sparse MCS. Specifically, we first pre-fill the general missing values using the classical Matrix Factorization (MF) technique. Then, we propose a neural network architecture based on Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Transformer to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies in the sensing data. Finally, we recover the complete data with a projection layer. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world urban sensing datasets. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid DoS Attack Intrusion Detection System (HDA-IDS) that combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to effectively identify both known and unknown DoS/botnet attacks. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel anomaly-based detection model called CL-GAN. It integrates CNN-LSTM with GAN to establish a baseline for normal behavior and detect malicious traffic. In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works.

    "abstract": "Identifying violent activities is important for ensuring the safety of society. Although the Transformer model contributes significantly to the field of behavior recognition, it often requires a substantial volume of data to perform well. Since existing datasets on violent behavior are currently lacking, it will be a challenge for Transformers to identify violent behavior with insufficient datasets. Additionally, Transformers are known to be computationally heavy and can sometimes overlook temporal features. To overcome these issues, an architecture named MLP-Mixer can be used to achieve comparable results with a smaller dataset. In this research, a special type of dataset to be fed into the MLP-Mixer called a sequential image collage (SIC) is proposed. This dataset is created by aggregating frames of video clips into image collages sequentially for the model to better understand the temporal features of violent behavior in videos. Three different public datasets, namely, the dataset of National Hockey League hockey fights, the dataset of smart-city CCTV violence detection, and the dataset of real-life violence situations were used to train the model. The results of the experiments proved that the model trained using the proposed SIC is capable of achieving high performance in violent behavior recognition with fewer parameters and FLOPs needed compared to other state-of-the-art models.",

To address these issues, we utilize the YOLOv8s model and a Swin Transformer block and introduce the PVswin-YOLOv8s model for pedestrian and vehicle detection based on UAVs.

Finally, we employ Soft-NMS to improve the accuracy of pedestrian and vehicle detection in occlusion situations. Soft-NMS increases performance and manages overlapped boundary boxes well. The proposed network reduced the fraction of small objects overlooked and enhanced model detection performance. Performance comparisons with different YOLO versions (for example YOLOv3 extremely small, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7), YOLOv8 variants (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, and YOLOv8l), and classical object detectors (Faster-RCNN, Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet, and CenterNet) were used to validate the superiority of the proposed PVswin-YOLOv8s model. The efficiency of the PVswin-YOLOv8s model was confirmed by the experimental findings, which showed a 4.8% increase in average detection accuracy (mAP) compared to YOLOv8s on the VisDrone2019 dataset.",

    "abstract": "In the modern world, human safety and crime control are daunting tasks. Each year the number of street crime cases has been increasing. In many cases, the culprit is unknown, in which the challenging task is to identify the right culprit possibly among hundreds of options in contexts of densely populated public spaces like target killing, vehicle snatching, etc. Often, in these situations, a sketch artist, working for the police forensic department, produces a drawing of the culprit’s face based on guidelines from the victims or witnesses to the crime. However, hand-drawn sketches can be an inefficient means for matching facial photographs of the culprit, particularly in cases where the software is designed around using images of real faces. In this research work, a novel technique is proposed to generate hyperreal high-definition (H-HD) face images of the culprit from a single hand-drawn face sketch. ’Hyperreal’ is used here in the way it is used in the Arts, as in making the image, albeit based on a person’s thoughts, truer to reality through a deep understanding of how the real subject would appear. To produce this image translation from sketch to H-HD face, two techniques are presented in this article, namely cycle generative adversarial network (CGAN) and multistage cycle generative adversarial network (MS-CGAN). MS-CGAN has multiple layers as stages and produces minimum cycle consistency and generative adversarial losses. CGAN uses paired data for training whereas MS-CGAN uses unpaired data. The training results show that the MSE loss of the proposed technique is found to be less than CGANs. GANs can be evaluated in three ways, namely qualitative, quantitative, and observational. In this paper, a quantitative comparison is made by the evaluation of CGAN and MS-CGAN based on the pixel-to-pixel comparison. An observational analysis is performed on the feedback from the observers. According to the evaluations, 54% of participants voted for the MS-CGAN whereas 46% rated CGAN to be the better performer. Two types of pixel-to-pixel comparisons are performed: color-to-color comparison and sketch-to-sketch comparison in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). For color-to-color image comparison, CGAN achieved an MSE of 2.312 and RMSE of 1.521 whereas MS-CGAN achieved an MSE of 2.232 and RMSE of 1.494. For sketch-to-sketch pixel comparison, CGAN achieved an MSE of 1.901 and RMSE of 1.379 whereas MS-CGAN achieved an MSE of 1.81 and 1.345 RMSE.

    "contribution": "In this research work, a novel technique is proposed to generate hyperreal high-definition (H-HD) face images of the culprit from a single hand-drawn face sketch. ’Hyperreal’ is used here in the way it is used in the Arts, as in making the image, albeit based on a person’s thoughts, truer to reality through a deep understanding of how the real subject would appear. To produce this image translation from sketch to H-HD face, two techniques are presented in this article, namely cycle generative adversarial network (CGAN) and multistage cycle generative adversarial network (MS-CGAN). MS-CGAN has multiple layers as stages and produces minimum cycle consistency and generative adversarial losses. CGAN uses paired data for training whereas MS-CGAN uses unpaired data. The training results show that the MSE loss of the proposed technique is found to be less than CGANs. GANs can be evaluated in three ways, namely qualitative, quantitative, and observational. In this paper, a quantitative comparison is made by the evaluation of CGAN and MS-CGAN based on the pixel-to-pixel comparison. An observational analysis is performed on the feedback from the observers. According to the evaluations, 54% of participants voted for the MS-CGAN whereas 46% rated CGAN to be the better performer. Two types of pixel-to-pixel comparisons are performed: color-to-color comparison and sketch-to-sketch comparison in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). For color-to-color image comparison, CGAN achieved an MSE of 2.312 and RMSE of 1.521 whereas MS-CGAN achieved an MSE of 2.232 and RMSE of 1.494. For sketch-to-sketch pixel comparison, CGAN achieved an MSE of 1.901 and RMSE of 1.379 whereas MS-CGAN achieved an MSE of 1.81 and 1.345 RMSE. The development of MS-CGAN and the research of this article are aimed at the police forensic department to generate a true-to-life H-HD face of a culprit and thereby contribute toward the overarching goal of maintaining a peaceful society.",
    "introduction": "In the modern world, human safety and crime control are daunting tasks. Each year the number of street crime cases has been increasing. In many cases, the culprit is unknown, in which the challenging task is to identify the right culprit possibly among hundreds of options in contexts of densely populated public spaces like target killing, vehicle snatching, etc. Often, in these situations, a sketch artist, working for the police forensic department, produces a drawing of the culprit’s face based on guidelines from the victims or witnesses to the crime. However, hand-drawn sketches can be an inefficient means for matching facial photographs of the culprit, particularly in cases where the software is designed around using images of real faces.",

It is a global issue causing technical and financial damage to governments and operators. Deep learning-based techniques can effectively identify consumers involved in energy theft through power consumption data. In this study, a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-based energy-theft-detection system is proposed to detect data-tampering cyber-attack vectors.

We employed CNN for feature extraction and traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. In this work, honest data were obtained from a real dataset. Six attack vectors causing data tampering were utilized. Tampered data were synthetically generated through these attack vectors. Six separate datasets were created for each attack vector to design a specialized detector tailored for that specific attack. Additionally, a dataset containing all attack vectors was also generated for the purpose of designing a general detector. Furthermore, the imbalanced dataset problem was addressed through the application of the generative adversarial network (GAN) method. GAN was chosen due to its ability to generate new data closely resembling real data, and its application in this field has not been extensively explored. The data generated with GAN ensured better training for the hybrid CNN-based detector on honest and malicious consumption patterns.

    "abstract": "Understanding the behavior of human motion in social environments is important for various domains of a smart city, e.g, smart transportation, automatic navigation of service robots, efficient navigation of autonomous cars and surveillance systems. Examining past trajectories or environmental factors alone are not enough to address this problem. We propose a novel methodology to predict future motion trajectories of humans based on past attitude of individuals, crowd attitude and environmental context. Many researchers have proposed different techniques based on different features extraction and features fusion to predict the future motion trajectory. They used traditional machine learning algorithms like SVM,social forces, probabilistic models and LSTM to analyze the heuristic motion trajectories but they didn’t consider the other environmental factors e.g relative positions of other humans present in environment and positions of objects present in environment which can affect the motion trajectories of humans. We intend to achieve this goal by employing Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) units to analyze motion histories, convolution neural networks to environmental facts e.g. human-human, human-object interaction and relative positioning of 80 different objects including pedestrians and generative adversarial networks(GANs) to predict possible future motion paths. Our proposed method achieved 70% lower Average Displacement Error(ADE) and 41% lower Final Displacement Error(FDE) in comparison to other state of the art techniques.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory forecasting of multiple agents is a fundamental task that has applications in various fields, such as autonomous driving, physical system modeling and smart cities. It is challenging because agent interactions and underlying continuous dynamics jointly affect its behavior. Existing approaches often rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Transformers to extract agent interaction features. However, they tend to neglect how the distance and velocity information between agents impact their interactions dynamically. Moreover, previous methods use RNNs or first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics, which may lack interpretability with respect to how each agent is driven by interactions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Agent Graph ODE, a novel approach that models agent interactions and continuous second-order dynamics explicitly. Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder architecture, incorporating spatial-temporal Transformers with distance information and dynamic interaction graph construction in the encoder module. In the decoder module, we employ GNNs with distance information to model agent interactions, and use coupled second-order ODEs to capture the underlying continuous dynamics by modeling the relationship between acceleration and agent interactions. Experimental results show that our proposed Agent Graph ODE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy. Moreover, our method performs well in sudden situations not seen in the training dataset.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized industries through interconnected devices and smart decision-making. However, this expansion has also introduced significant security challenges, as IoT networks are characterized by heterogeneity, resource constraints, and evolving threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have emerged as essential mechanisms to complement preventive measures, yet existing solutions fall short of addressing the full spectrum of IoT-specific vulnerabilities. This paper critically reviews state-of-the-art IDS techniques, including advanced methods such as machine learning, federated learning, blockchain, and hybrid detection. Additionally, emerging approaches like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), reinforcement learning, and bio-inspired algorithms are explored for their potential to enhance IDS adaptability and scalability. The role of complementary security techniques, such as penetration testing, is highlighted in validating and strengthening IDS implementations. Applications in critical areas such as smart cities are discussed, emphasizing the need for robust and efficient security mechanisms. Key challenges such as interoperability, real-time detection, and resource efficiency are analyzed, and future research directions are proposed to develop comprehensive IDS frameworks tailored to the dynamic and diverse IoT ecosystem.",

Machine learning (ML) methods—ranging from classical ensemble models to deep learning architectures and reinforcement learning—provide powerful mechanisms for anomaly detection, failure prediction, operational optimization, and scenario modeling. This review explores the essential ML algorithms, their application contexts, and the supportive infrastructures required for implementing ML-driven DT solutions.

    "abstract": "Drone imagery analysis is an essential part of smart city construction and management. Object detection in UAV images has been a popular research topic recently. The images captured by drones usually have huge scale changes due to the flying and shooting at different altitudes, which puts a burden on traditional deep learning networks. The Transformer-based network has proven successful in computer vision tasks due to its strong long sequence memory analysis capabilities. This article will design a network for object detection and analysis of drone images based on the Transformer structure. The main challenge with using transformers is the high computational cost of processing image sequences, so the common method is to use local attention instead of global attention and a hierarchical structure to compensate for the loss of global vision. However, the large amount of information lost caused by using local attention can not be made up for with this action simply. This paper analyzes the ideas of multiscale and hierarchical structure concepts and attention mechanisms, and embeds multiscale concepts into the local attention structure to further make up for the global view information lost. In order to achieve this, we used the pooling concept to build multiscale pooling layers combined with a pyramid structure and applied it to the multi-head self-attention module. At the same time, we precut the image features entering the pooling block to reduce the length of the image token sequence. While reducing the calculation amount of the vision transformer, the global visual field information is increased as much as possible to obtain better contextual features. On VisDrone dataset, MRPVT as a backbone achieves 47.98% AP50 and 25.20% AP75 accuracy and on UAVDT's car category achieves 98.84% AP50 and 89.27% AP75 accuracy. As expected, MRPVT delivers great performance on drone-captured images' object detection and visual aesthetic assessment.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for data-driven applications requires AI solutions that are both efficient and scalable to support big data analytics across diverse industries. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer advanced performance but incur high computational costs, latency, and energy demands, making them less suitable for real-time analytics or edge computing. Small Language Models (SLMs), like LLaMA 2 and Mistral 7B, have been developed to address these challenges by reducing cost and power consumption while retaining high task-specific performance. This paper explores how SLMs integrate within hybrid AI architectures, handling sub-tasks like pre-processing and localized inference, while LLMs perform complex analytics in cloud environments. Such hybrid architectures present scalable, efficient solutions for sectors including finance, healthcare, and smart cities. The challenges of SLM integration, such as reduced contextual understanding and accuracy tradeoffs, are also addressed. Further, we propose future directions to mitigate these issues, including AutoML frameworks, federated learning, and quantization techniques to enhance model efficiency. This paper discusses deployment strategies for SLMs within hybrid architectures to achieve balanced performance, scalability, and efficiency in big data applications.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of IoT-powered smart cities has generated substantial apprehensions regarding energy efficiency and security. Current technologies frequently fail to adequately address these concerns in a comprehensive manner. This study presents a hybrid framework that combines GAN with ICA to improve energy efficiency and security in smart city infrastructures. The design of the model utilizes GANs to generate synthetic data and ICA to extract independent characteristics, resulting in improved accuracy and security of IoT systems.

Feature extraction is performed by employing Graph Attention Network (GAN) to handle complexity. For classification, GCN-GLSTM is used to handle high-dimensionality, and to enhance generalizability.

    "abstract": "In the context of smart cities, there is a growing demand for risk-free navigation systems that help citizens avoid congestion and enjoy outdoor activities in clean environments. Such systems require the ability to predict traffic and environmental hotspots by analyzing spatial-temporal big data from various sources, including IoT devices, stations, CCTV, and personal device networks. However, analyzing and forecasting spatial-temporal data presents significant challenges due to the complex interplay of spatial and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel dual attention mechanism graph transformer that leverages both spatial and temporal information to capture intricate patterns in spatial-temporal data. We evaluate our model on two forecasting tasks: air pollution and traffic flow. Our results demonstrate superior performance compared to other graph neural network models. Consequently, this model has been integrated into a traffic-risk navigator application, which will be evaluated in Yokohama, Japan, using real data collected from air pollution stations and traffic monitors.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are increasingly being implemented in smart cities, where they are designed to provide 3D digital representations for near-real time interactivity and status feedback of the twinned physical assets. The ability to provide accurate predictions in what-if scenarios plays a key role in driving the advances in resources optimization and risk mitigation. To this end, prediction models require large datasets to train, and such datasets are usually scarce at local level. In this paper, we propose a generative AI-based workflow to infer domestic photovoltaic energy production data, based on a process that uses Generative Adversarial Networks to generate an enriched meteorological dataset. The generated meteorological data captures essential statistical properties of real data that can be later used to infer realistic energy production data points. The resulting output dataset is validated against a real photovoltaic system, highlighting the ability to deliver high-fidelity time series out of scarce input datasets.",

    "abstract": "Precipitation nowcasting is an important spatiotemporal prediction task to predict the radar echoes sequences based on current observations, which can serve both meteorological science and smart city applications. Due to the chaotic evolution nature of the precipitation systems, it is a very challenging problem. Previous studies address the problem either from the perspectives of deterministic modeling or probabilistic modeling. However, their predictions suffer from the blurry, high-value echoes fading away and position inaccurate issues. The root reason of these issues is that the chaotic evolutionary precipitation systems are not appropriately modeled. Inspired by the nature of the systems, we propose to decompose and model them from the perspective of global deterministic motion and local stochastic variations with residual mechanism. A unified and flexible framework that can equip any type of spatio-temporal models is proposed based on residual diffusion, which effectively tackles the shortcomings of previous methods. Extensive experimental results on four publicly available radar datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicle (AV) decision-making in ur-ban environments is inherently challenging due to the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles. For safe planning, AV/ego must understand the weightage of various spatiotemporal interactions in a scene. Contemporary works use colos-sal transformer architectures to encode interactions mainly for trajectory prediction, resulting in increased computational complexity. To address this issue without compromising spatiotemporal understanding and performance, we propose the simple Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DAD-RL) framework, which dynamically assigns and incorporates the significance of surrounding vehicles into the ego's RL-driven decision-making process. We introduce an AV-centric spatiotemporal attention encoding (STAE) mechanism for learning the dynamic interactions with different surrounding vehicles. To understand map and route context, we employ a context encoder to extract features from context maps. The spatiotemporal representations combined with contextual encoding provide a comprehensive state representation. The resulting model is trained using the Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm. We evaluate the proposed framework on the SMARTS urban benchmarking scenarios without traffic signals to demonstrate that DAD-RL outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an ablation study underscores the importance of the context-encoder and spatiotemporal attention encoder in achieving superior performance.",

    "abstract": "The rapid acceleration of urbanization underscores the urgent need for developing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to enhance the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of urban mobility. Within this context, accurately predicting vehicle trajectories is paramount for facilitating superior traffic management and control. To this end, the paper presents an innovative architecture that combines a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module with a generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) component, specifically the RoBERTa Transformer model. By leveraging these sophisticated architecture, the LSTM network with a recursive decoder outperforms the teacher forcing decoder on clean datasets, showing higher robustness in time-series predictions. When video data was partially missing, performance decreased, but using the RoBERTa model to reconstruct the missing data significantly improved results for both decoders (from 37% up to 92%). The reconstructed data notably enhanced the performance of the LSTM models, particularly when larger portions of the video data were absent. These findings highlight the effectiveness of data reconstruction techniques in mitigating the challenges posed by uncontrollable events (common in real ITS scenarios) which can bear to incomplete information.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Digital Twin (DT) technology represents a significant milestone in the evolution of smart city management, introducing virtual models and data-driven simulations that enhance our understanding, planning, and management of urban environments. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) integration enriches digital twins by boosting their predictive capabilities and simulating more realistic and interactive scenarios. By leveraging generative algorithms, digital twins can create synthetic data, to simulate a wide range of potential outcomes. These additional capabilities enable more accurate modeling of complex systems, predicting variations and potential issues. Moreover, Generative AI can contribute to creating high-quality simulations, improving the accuracy and reliability of digital twins in representing real-world environments and processes. This chapter provides an exploration of the synergies between GenAI and digital twins in the context of disaster management and smart cities. The chapter begins with an introduction, offering a contextual background integrating generative AI and digital twins for simulating disaster and emergency scenarios. It then delves into the foundations of generative AI, discussing its principles, applications, and success stories across various domains, with a specific focus on its relevance to urban disaster management. The subsequent sections clarify the evolution of digital twins and their pivotal role in predicting and mitigating disasters and emergency response. The chapter then navigates the intersection between generative AI and digital twins and the functionalities that GenAI brings to improving the simulation process, providing examples of successful integrations while addressing potential challenges and proposing solutions. Furthermore, it explores how smart cities contribute to disaster resilience, detailing the technologies and strategies employed for disaster preparedness.

    "abstract": "Human mobility prediction is fundamental to designing intelligent cities and forecasting how people move during disasters and health emergencies, specifically in emergency responses. However, the existing method for human mobility prediction is mainly designed for normal scenarios and is incapable of handling the case of a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges over the past few years: the powerful pandemic has a fundamental and long-lasting influence on mobility, which is hard to model. Inspired by recent progress in the Large Language Model, we present the Human Mobility Prediction-Large Language Model (HMP-LLM), which utilizes LLMs with understanding and reasoning abilities to do human mobility prediction tasks. Especially to adapt LLMs to intervened time series prediction, we propose the following critical designs: 1) Seasonal Decompose. 2) Two-stage Prompts Designing. We convert the input data into textual prototypes so LLMs can understand it, then we use two-stage prompts to guide the language model in reasoning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm the superiority of HMP-LLM over existing methods. Besides, due to the zero-shot nature and the expansibility of our two-stage design, HMP-LLM is expected to be used in other public safety incidents.",

    "abstract": "The fifth-generation (5G) offers advanced services, supporting applications such as intelligent transportation, con-nected healthcare, and smart cities within the Internet of Things (IoT). However, these advancements introduce significant security challenges, with increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a robust intrusion detection system (IDS) using federated learning and large language models (LLMs). The core of our IDS is based on BERT, a transformer model adapted to identify malicious network flows. We modified this transformer to optimize performance on edge devices with limited resources. Experiments were conducted in both centralized and federated learning contexts. In the centralized setup, the model achieved an inference accuracy of 97.79 %. In a federated learning context, the model was trained across multiple devices using both IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) and non-IID data, based on various scenarios, ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulations. We also leveraged linear quantization to com-press the model for deployment on edge devices. This reduction resulted in a slight decrease of 0.02 % in accuracy for a model size reduction of 28.74 %. The results underscore the viability of LLMs for deployment in IoT ecosystems, highlighting their ability to operate on devices with constrained computational and storage resources.",

By incorporating sensors, IoT devices, and advanced data analytics, the system can predict traffic flow, optimize signal timings, and recommend alternate routes. It also communicates with connected vehicles to provide real-time updates. The incorporation of Generative AI enables the AITMS to continually adapt and learn from new data inputs and trends, ensuring sustainability and scalability in urban transportation. AITMS is an innovative framework enhanced by Generative AI, aimed at revolutionizing urban traffic management in smart cities.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology, the resolution of remote sensing satellites is improving, the number of spectral bands is increasing, and revisit periods are contracting. This progression empowers researchers to access more valuable data and information from remote sensing images. Concepts, such as remote sensing big data, remote sensing foundation models, and smart cities, have successively emerged in recent years, imposing increased demands on the intelligent extraction technology of massive remote sensing data, particularly regarding remote sensing image information. As an indispensable element of intelligent information extraction technology applied in fields, such as land use and cover, national land resource surveys, natural disaster observation, agricultural yield estimation, and forestry protection, remote sensing image classification exhibits substantial practical importance. Remote sensing image scene classification has been introduced in this context. The objective of scene classification in remote sensing images is to comprehensively and semantically categorize each given remote sensing image. This task entails summarizing and analyzing the extracted feature information at a high level and assigning different labels to areas of interest based on their features. In contrast with natural images, although they contain features, such as color, texture, and shape, remote sensing images encounter more challenges in classification due to the intricate scene content resulting from the overhead perspective, weak texture, and color information caused by low resolution. Nevertheless, as one of the technical means in remote sensing applications, remote sensing image scene classification technology plays a pivotal role in the development of practical application technologies. After years of development, numerous comprehensive review studies on remote sensing image scene classification have been conducted locally and abroad. However, the recent surge in remote sensing big data has introduced new challenges into scene classification. The ongoing evolution of deep learning technology, particularly the widespread application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, has resulted in significant advancements in remote sensing image scene classification. In this context, self-supervised learning, as a method that is independent of annotated data, has become indispensable in the field of remote sensing image scene classification. Foundation models based on self-supervised learning have been successfully implemented in scene classification, presenting innovative solutions to this field. As the volume of remote sensing data continues to increase, the dataset scale for remote sensing image scene classification is expanding rapidly, giving rise to increasingly intricate classification tasks. Remote sensing image scene classification datasets are swiftly progressing toward the integration of multiple sources, the incorporation of multiple labels, and the inclusion of large-scale samples. Drawing from the findings of the current literature survey, this study systematically compiles a summary of deep learning methods within the domain of remote sensing image scene classification. Encompassing CNNs, visual transformers, and generative adversarial networks, this overview also introduces representative datasets and foundation models since the inception of scene classification. Several classical scene classification methods have undergone evaluation across various benchmark datasets. In addition, this study delves into primary challenges and prospects, paving the way for further research in the classification of scenes in remote sensing images.",

This paper explores the application of LLMs in managing 6G-empowered DT networks, with a focus on optimizing data retrieval and communication efficiency in smart city scenarios. The proposed framework leverages LLMs for intelligent DT problem analysis and radio resource management (RRM) in fully autonomous way without any manual intervention. Our proposed framework - LINKs, builds up a lazy loading strategy which can minimize transmission delay by selectively retrieving the relevant data. Based on the data retrieval plan, LLMs transform the retrieval task into an numerical optimization problem and utilizing solvers to build an optimal RRM, ensuring efficient communication across the network. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvements in data planning and network management, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance the integration of DT and 6G technologies.",

This paper presents a novel approach based on Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, to tackle the problem of outdoor landmark detection. Accurately identifying landmarks from images is the research challenge; this is an essential function for tourism, navigation, and cultural preservation. This approach is implemented using a state-of-the-art neural network architecture to effectively capture long-range relationships in images. The results highlight that the ViT model outperforms conventional convolutional neural networks in challenging outdoor conditions by having a higher accuracy rate when identifying landmarks.

    "abstract": "Image caption generation has become a prominent area of research due to its potential applications in multimedia understanding and accessibility. This paper presents a comprehensive study of three state-of-the-art approaches for image caption generation, employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers. The first approach utilises a CNN-LSTM architecture, where the CNN acts as an encoder to extract meaningful visual features from input images. These features are then fed into an LSTM-based decoder, enabling the generation of descriptive captions. The second approach introduces the use of attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on specific regions of the image while generating captions. This technique improves the caption quality and ensures that the generated text corresponds more accurately to the content in the image. Lastly, the third approach incorporates the powerful transformer architecture to capture long-range dependencies in the generated captions, enabling better contextual understanding and coherence.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of intelligent industry and smart city increases the number of surveillance devices, greatly enhancing the need for unsupervised automatic anomaly detection in real-Time video surveillance, which uses raw data without laborious manual annotations. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods encounter limitations when utilizing pretext tasks, such as reconstruction or prediction to identify abnormal events, as these tasks are not completely consistent and complementary with the essential objective of anomaly detection. Motivated by recent advances in diffusion models, we propose a multiscale recovery diffusion model, which relies on the proposed novel and effective pretext task named recovery to introduce the notion of generation speed. It utilizes critical step-by-step generation of diffusion probabilistic models in unsupervised anomaly detection scenarios. By incorporating a proposed multiscale spatial-Temporal subtraction module, our model captures more detailed appearance and motion information of foreground objects without relying on other high-level pretrained models. Furthermore, an innovative push-pull loss further extends the disparity between normal and abnormal events through pseudolabels. We validate our model on five established benchmarks: UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and UCF-Crime, achieving frame-level area under the curves of 86.01%, 99.23%, 92.35%, 82.49%, and 74.79%, respectively, surpassing other state-of-The-Art unsupervised VAD methods.",

The identification of complex and emerging botnet attacks has not been entirely contained by traditional methods of botnet detection. In this study, we present a new hybrid approach, called GNN-WGAN, to efficiently detect bots in IoT-based smart city networks by integrating Graph Neural Network and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network. The suggested method, which ultimately aims to improve the precision and robustness against botnet detection in dynamic IoT networks, effectively uses WGANs to generate synthetic botnet traffic patterns to add more training data and GNNs to capture dependencies between and interactions across network topology. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GNN-WGAN technique in accurately recognizing botnet activities, which enhances the security and resilience of IoT networks in smart cities.",

Where is the place of Africa in the 21st-century technological world? In this chapter, we adopt a qualitative method to bolster our argument that smart cities in Africa have progressed over the years and positively influenced African digital space and beyond.

    "abstract": "Biometric authentication systems are increasingly needed across a broad range of applications including in smart city environments (e.g., entering hotels), and in smart home environments (e.g., controlling smart devices). Traditional methods, such as face-based and fingerprint-based authentication, usually incur high costs to be installed in all this kind of environments. In this paper, we develop a ubiquitous low-effort user authentication approach, mmPalm, based on palm recognition using millimeter wave (mmWave) signals. mmWave technology has been adopted by WiGig and 5G, making mmPalm a low-cost solution that can be widely adopted in public places. In addition, the high resolution of mmWave signals allows mmPalm to extract detailed palm characteristics (e.g., palm geometry, skin thickness, and texture) that can assemble distinctive palmprints for user authentication. Our innovative virtual antennas design further increases the spatial resolution of a commercial mmWave device, enabling it to fully capture the comprehensive palmprint features. Moreover, to address the challenge of small-scale environmental changes (e.g., variations in palm-device distances and palm orientations), we design a novel palm profile augmentation method, utilizing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic palm profiles for mitigating palm instability. Furthermore, we design a cross-environment adaptation framework based on transfer learning to address the challenge of large-scale environmental changes, including multipath variations introduced by human bodies and nearby furniture. Extensive experiments with 30 participants through 6 months demonstrate that mmPalm achieves 99% authentication accuracy with resilience against different types of attacks, including random, impersonation, and counterfeit.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring effective object tracking within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in smart cities is pivotal for enhancing urban mobility and sustainability. However, challenges arise, particularly in scenarios with occlusions and adverse weather conditions, where traditional methods may fall short in ensuring safety. To address these challenges, a novel track-by-detection approach is introduced aimed at enhancing transportation systems. The approach integrates key components, including the Detection Transformer (DETR) for emphasizing global context, and the You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) renowned for capturing local context. Additionally, the deep sort tracking filter is incorporated to enhance object tracking accuracy. A pivotal aspect of the approach lies in the utilization of the deep sort of filter for object tracking, preceded by preprocessing with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to refine tracking outcomes. This buffering approach significantly improves tracking quality by reducing noise and enhancing feature representation. Moreover, the approach leverages tracking from satellite videos, enabling comprehensive monitoring of transportation activities across vast regions. The refined tracking outputs, including those from satellite videos, are fused with direct outputs from the trackers obtained from both YOLOv7 and DETR. These integrated fused buffered tracked bounding boxes demonstrate superior performance compared to individual approaches. Validation using simulated imagery under cloudy conditions, incorporating the Motion Evaluation Metric (MOT), showcases enhanced accuracy across various transportation objects. Implementing this approach in ITS promise's benefits such as enhanced traffic management and increased efficiency in public transportation.

    "abstract": "Building type information indicates the functional properties of buildings and plays a crucial role in smart city development and urban socio-economic activities. Existing methods for classifying building types often face challenges in accurately distinguishing buildings between types while maintaining well-delineated boundaries, especially in complex urban environments. This study introduces a novel framework, i.e., CNN-Transformer cross-attention feature fusion network (CTCFNet), for building type classification from very-high-resolution remote sensing images. CTCFNet integrates CNNs and Transformers using an interactive cross-encoder fusion (ICEF) module that enhances semantic feature learning and improves classification accuracy in complex scenarios. We develop an adaptive collaboration optimization (ACO) module that applies human visual attention mechanisms to enhance the feature representation of building types and boundaries simultaneously. To address the scarcity of datasets in building type classification, we create two new datasets: the urban building type (UBT) dataset and the town building type (TBT) dataset, for model evaluation. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that CTCFNet outperforms popular CNNs, Transformers, and dual-encoder methods in identifying building types across various regions, achieving the highest MIoU of 78.20% and 77.11%, F1 scores of 86.83% and 88.22%, and OA of 95.07% and 95.73% on the UBT and TBT datasets, respectively. We conclude that CTCFNet effectively addresses the challenges of high interclass similarity and intraclass inconsistency in complex scenes, yielding results with well-delineated building boundaries and accurate building types.

In recent years, artificial intelligence has provided a valuable supplement to conventional inspection practices, potentially offering a supporting tool for building maintenance in smart cities. Exploiting machine learning algorithms for detecting or classifying building facade defects from acquired images has emerged as a promising automatic building monitoring strategy. However, an effective approach should be capable of accurately classifying fine-grained defects, thus requiring ad-hoc solutions to maximize predictive accuracy. For this reason, in this work, we introduced a novel and effective classification protocol, based on different ensemble strategies of complex and recent deep neural networks, namely Vision Transformers and ConvNexts, for building facade defects automatic classification. First, we validated our method on a popular benchmark dataset with different damage classification tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art available works. Then, we analyzed a custom dataset, named Facade Building Defects (FBD), containing building facade images labeled into four different defect classes, that we introduced in this work and released as open access. The proposed ensemble showed a test accuracy of 90.9%, achieving an improvement of 1.6% with respect to the best single model, thus empirically proving the benefit of model ensembling for the task of automatic building facade defects classification.",

    "abstract": "When it comes to smart healthcare business systems, network-based intrusion detection systems are crucial for protecting the system and its networks from malicious network assaults. To protect IoMT devices and networks in healthcare and medical settings, our proposed model serves as a powerful tool for monitoring IoMT networks. This study presents a robust methodology for intrusion detection in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environments, integrating data augmentation, feature selection, and ensemble learning to effectively handle IoMT data complexity. Following rigorous preprocessing, including feature extraction, correlation removal, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), selected features are standardized and reshaped for deep learning models. Augmentation using the BAT algorithm enhances dataset variability. Three deep learning models, Transformer-based neural networks, self-attention Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are trained to capture diverse data aspects. Their predictions form a meta-feature set for a subsequent meta-learner, which combines model strengths. Conventional classifiers validate meta-learner features for broad algorithm suitability. This comprehensive method demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in IoMT intrusion detection. Evaluations were conducted using two datasets: the publicly available WUSTL-EHMS-2020 dataset, which contains two distinct categories, and the CICIoMT2024 dataset, encompassing sixteen categories. Experimental results showcase the method’s exceptional performance, achieving optimal scores of 100% on the WUSTL-EHMS-2020 dataset and 99% on the CICIoMT2024.",

    "contribution": "This study presents a robust methodology for intrusion detection in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environments, integrating data augmentation, feature selection, and ensemble learning to effectively handle IoMT data complexity. Following rigorous preprocessing, including feature extraction, correlation removal, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), selected features are standardized and reshaped for deep learning models. Augmentation using the BAT algorithm enhances dataset variability. Three deep learning models, Transformer-based neural networks, self-attention Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are trained to capture diverse data aspects. Their predictions form a meta-feature set for a subsequent meta-learner, which combines model strengths. Conventional classifiers validate meta-learner features for broad algorithm suitability. This comprehensive method demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in IoMT intrusion detection. Evaluations were conducted using two datasets: the publicly available WUSTL-EHMS-2020 dataset, which contains two distinct categories, and the CICIoMT2024 dataset, encompassing sixteen categories. Experimental results showcase the method’s exceptional performance, achieving optimal scores of 100% on the WUSTL-EHMS-2020 dataset and 99% on the CICIoMT2024.",
    "introduction": "When it comes to smart healthcare business systems, network-based intrusion detection systems are crucial for protecting the system and its networks from malicious network assaults. To protect IoMT devices and networks in healthcare and medical settings, our proposed model serves as a powerful tool for monitoring IoMT networks.",

    "abstract": "Recent cybersecurity research is shifting to favor adversarial attacks, which are harder to detect and counteract, as they are not apparent, and they exploit the vulnerability of the deployed machine learning model. With machine learning seeing wider adoption to forecast the electricity load in smart cities to help maintain grid stability and better integrate with renewable energies, the energy sector is at risk. Although several methods exist to mitigate the problem, adversarial training fails against the attack that utilizes a surrogate model. In addition, it cannot differentiate between the original and adversarial data without relying on adversarial detection. Furthermore, existing detections do not correct the data to keep the forecast running. In this paper, the Multivariable Convolutional Encoder implementation in a Trusted Input Framework was proposed, which utilizes hidden input data with a high correlation to act as a trap when creating the surrogate model, measuring the attack intensity, and improve the accuracy to 'correct' and 'forecast' on the target data. In the experiment, the proposed method not only fooled the surrogate but also achieved a coefficient of determination score of 0.9183 on the most robust Projected Gradient Descent-based adversarial attack, which is 13.933% better than the adversarial training.",

    "abstract": "A city's economic growth is heavily influenced by its transport infrastructure, since the demand to move workers, customers, and goods is on the rise. Intelligent transport systems (ITS) are an integral part of the smart cities project. These systems use state-of-the-art technology to solve traffic problems. There are a lot of ITS solutions in use all over the world right now. The approach consists of three phases, which are feature selection, feature extraction, and model training. The goal of feature selection in smart cities is to identify relevant qualities and exclude those that aren't essential in order to collect data that correctly represents the problem at hand while reducing inefficiencies. A variant of principal component analysis (PCA) that has gained favor in feature extraction, kernel-PCA allows one to understand nonlinearities in data. A KNN-TACGAN was used for the model's training. Compared to KNN and TACGAN, the proposed technique has a better average accuracy of 92.47%.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization presents formidable challenges to global urban transportation systems, accentuating safety concerns amidst burgeoning vehicular traffic. Commercial vehicles, owing to their prevalence and size, significantly contribute to congestion and accidents. Statistics from authoritative bodies such as Malaysia Highway Authority (LLM) underscore this severity, with large trucks notably implicated in a significant share of traffic fatalities. Asia, among rapid urbanization, grapples with heightened road safety issues, as emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO). The alarming statistics reveal substantial involvement of commercial vehicles in traffic-related fatalities, necessitating urgent innovative interventions. In response, this research advocates for the Smart Urban Vehicular Traffic Management System, harnessing automatic control and intelligent systems integrated with Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in a cloud computing environment to boost safety and efficiency in commercial vehicle operations. Addressing challenges inherent in the traditional cloud computing paradigm, particularly with the increasing AIoT devices, we propose an edge-cloud architecture. Leveraging by the federated learning techniques, this architecture ensures privacy while optimizing service quality for AIoT devices essential to commercial vehicle management. Central to this proposal is the pursuit of scalability and adaptability, promising transformative impacts on urban traffic safety.

    "abstract": "As wireless communication technology progresses towards the sixth generation (6G), high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has emerged as a promising candidate for enabling vehicular networks. It offers high data rates and low-latency communication. However, obstacles such as buildings, trees, and other vehicles can cause signal attenuation and blockage, leading to communication failures that can result in fatal accidents or traffic congestion. Predicting blockages is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient communications. Furthermore, the advent of 6G technology is anticipated to integrate advanced sensing capabilities, utilizing a variety of sensor types. These sensors, ranging from traditional RF sensors to cameras and Lidar sensors, are expected to provide access to rich multimodal data, thereby enriching communication systems with a wealth of additional contextual information. Leveraging this multimodal data becomes essential for making precise network management decisions, including the crucial task of blockage detection. In this paper, we propose a Deep Learning (DL)-based approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and customized Vision Transformers (ViTs) to effectively extract essential information from multimodal data and predict blockages in vehicular networks. We train and evaluate our proposed method on the DL dataset framework for vision-aided wireless communications (ViWi) and demonstrate its potential for predicting blockages in vehicular networks through simulations. The results show that the proposed approach achieves over 95% accurate predictions, proving its potential for integration into 6G vehicular networks to enhance communication reliability and support advanced applications such as autonomous driving and smart city infrastructure. These findings underscore the practical significance and future impact of our work in advancing ultra-reliable and low-latency communication systems.",

    "abstract": "This book chapter seeks to present a concise introduction and contextualization affecting the topics correlated to the disruptive perspectives of vehicle electrification in modern power grids, welcoming innovative power electronics technologies, and control challenges in support of the power grid interface. As demonstrated in this book chapter, the main objective is to combine in a single book, power electronics technologies and control strategies for vehicle electrification in modern power grids in a future viewpoint, indicating that vehicle electrification is facing challenges, but it is also of added value for the power grid: in terms of power electronics technologies covered aspects such as power charging and traction systems; the interface of the vehicle electrification with renewables and energy storage systems; vehicle electrification operating as power quality conditioners for the power grid; vehicle electrification framed with solid-state transformers and within AC, DC, and hybrid power grids; vehicle electrification in smart homes, smart cities, and smart grids; and advanced topologies of power electronics converters. To deal with the increasing penetration of vehicle electrification, control strategies are also retained: for the power electronics converters; for interfacing renewable energy sources and energy storage systems as support of electric mobility; for operation modes, e.g., innovative modes in addition of vehicle-to-grid; for ensuring power quality and reliability in smart grids; for demand response strategies; and for forecasting strategies.",

This poses a major problem especially in the context of electricity load prediction where high quality data are essential. To address this issue, this paper presents a framework that transforms datasets with missing values into high quality and high-resolution datasets using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The capability of this framework was exhibited through a case study, the CIC-IPN electricity consumption dataset. Results show that the framework was able to successfully impute the missing values in the dataset while capturing the general patterns in the data. This framework can then be used to upscale other electricity datasets that contain missing values which can then be further used for electricity load prediction for smart cities and smart buildings.",

However, these applications often face a significant challenge - data scarcity. Insufficient data limits the effectiveness of machine learning models in the context of ITS. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel data augmentation solution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By collecting sensor-based traffic speed data with contextual labels and training a GAN-based model to generate realistic traffic data for specific days and times, this research successfully proposes a solution to the problem of data scarcity. The generated data undergoes comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its potential to enhance ITS applications. Furthermore, the generated data is utilized to augment the training data for multiple traffic prediction models, effectively enhancing their performance. This approach opens new avenues for the development of intelligent and sustainable transportation systems, ultimately contributing to the advancement of smarter and more resilient cities.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrated all aspects of our lives through smart cities, health, industries and others that are related to people's livelihood. With the increasing number of IoT devices, more and more personal information is exposed in the network space, which inevitably brings some network security problems. Due to the diversity and heterogeneity of IoT devices, identification of such devices in the complex IoT environments remains a major challenge. Existing deep learning-based device identification methods achieve identification of IoT devices by automatically extracting device traffic features, but usually only single modal features of device traffic are considered, which cannot achieve all-around characterization features of communication traffic and affect the identification results. Therefore, we propose an identification method, termed DMRMTT, that employs a Deep convolutional maxout network and MTT model (Multiple Time-series Transformers) to automatically extract the spatial and temporal features of IoT communication session fingerprints and perform further fusion using the structure of the residual, which makes up for the limitations of the existing methods for studying device traffic. This method can improve the characterization of device traffic behaviour and achieve a more accurate identification of IoT devices. Its efficacy is experimentally validated by using two publicly availbale datasets and compared with existing methods. Results show that our method outperforms other methods in widely used performance metrics and achieves 99.82% identification accuracy, demonstrating its superiority and usefulness in IoT device identification.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart cities, the collection of vehicle trajectory data through sensors has increased significantly. While many studies have utilized calibrated physical car-following models (CFM) and machine learning techniques for trajectory prediction, these approaches often falter in complex, dynamic traffic scenarios. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces PS-TrajGAIL, a generative adversarial imitation learning framework tailored for urban vehicle trajectory generation. Contrary to conventional discriminative models, PS-TrajGAIL employs a generative model to capture the inherent distribution of urban vehicle trajectories. This framework models the tasks of trajectory generation as a partially observable Markov decision process based on imitation learning. PS-TrajGAIL's architecture features a generator, which simulates vehicle behavior to produce synthetic trajectories, and a discriminator that distinguishes between authentic and generated trajectories. In addition, the driving policy within the generator is fine-tuned using the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) algorithm, ensuring safety in vehicle driving. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets highlight that PS-TrajGAIL notably surpasses existing baselines and state-of-the-art approaches in trajectory generation.",

    "abstract": "Due to the growing level of transportation systems, numerous social troubles arise and create serious hazards like air pollution, the greenhouse effect, and traffic congestion. Hence, Traffic forecasting is essential for providing numerous applications in smart city management like congestion avoidance, navigation guidance, and urban traffic control. Still, the traffic prediction is difficult, since each road network is greatly dependent on other networks in a temporally and spatially manner. For capturing the temporal and spatial dependency, the Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX) - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Forward Taylor Network (NxLFTN)based traffic forecasting is proposed in this paper. The traffic network is considered as a graph, which contains the spatio-temporal data. The spatio-temporal data is high-dimensional and complex. To embed the data into a low-dimensionality region, the spatio-temporal embedding (STE) generator is employed. Moreover, the STE generator is used for predicting the daily embedding and the weekly embedding of the time related to the present traffic signal. At last, the traffic forecasting is carried out using the NxLFTNet. In addition, the Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Root Mean square error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to validate the effectiveness of the NxLFTNet.

Vehicle routing problems, which are a combinatorial problem, need to be solved in the design of the relevant systems. In this regard, the use of artificial intelligence optimization algorithms such as meta-heuristics has increased significantly in recent years. To the best of our knowledge, there are no papers that address the Dial and Ride problem by using reinforcement learning, one of the learning-based models. In this study, the Dial and Ride problem is solved for a single service vehicle using the transformer-based deep reinforcement learning method. The proposed method is tested on a problem generated in an environment in Eskişehir Büyükdere Neighborhood. As a result of the test problem, it is shown that the proposed method produced a solution to the problem in a reasonable time. The study showed that the Dial and Ride Problems can be solved with reinforcement learning.",

Vehicle routing problems, which are a combinatorial problem, need to be solved in the design of the relevant systems. In this regard, the use of artificial intelligence optimization algorithms such as meta-heuristics has increased significantly in recent years. To the best of our knowledge, there are no papers that address the Dial and Ride problem by using reinforcement learning, one of the learning-based models.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of 4G and 5G mobile networks in smart cities, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has surged, emphasizing the critical need for robust security measures. Existing firmware attestation techniques often require high computational budget or access to the device's authentic firmware, posing challenges due to resource and proprietary constraints. To counter these two fundamental challenges, this article introduces a novel software-based attestation framework utilizing RAM traces from IoT devices for remote verification. In the proposed framework, the need for an authentic firmware copy is eliminated, and the most computationally intensive task is assigned to the gateway node of the IoT ecosystem. This approach yields a robust and highly accurate device attestation strategy, while imposing minimal computational demands on the verification device itself. Employing deep learning models trained in a representation learning paradigm, our framework enables the remote verifier to authenticate the internal state of IoT devices. Leveraging data collected from real-world prototype devices, under eight different applications, our approach achieves a remarkable 100% accuracy in detecting critical attacks on IoT devices with a false positive rate of 10-3 Notably, our framework preserves device availability and maintains low authentication latency, underscoring its efficacy and practicality for securing IoT ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "In the digital era, data has become a pivotal asset, advancing technologies such as autonomous driving. Despite this, data trading faces challenges like the absence of robust pricing methods and the lack of trustworthy trading mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce a traffic-oriented data trading platform named Data on The Move (DTM), integrating traffic simulation, data trading, and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents. The DTM platform supports evident-based data value evaluation and AI-based trading mechanisms. Leveraging the common sense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess traffic state and data value, DTM can determine reasonable traffic data pricing through multi-round interaction and simulations. Moreover, DTM provides a pricing method validation by simulating traffic systems, multi-agent interactions, and the heterogeneity and irrational behaviors of individuals in the trading market. Within the DTM platform, entities such as connected vehicles and traffic light controllers could engage in information collecting, data pricing, trading, and decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed AI agent-based pricing approach enhances data trading by offering rational prices, as evidenced by the observed improvement in traffic efficiency. This underscores the effectiveness and practical value of DTM, offering new perspectives for the evolution of data markets and smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study employing LLMs in data pricing and a pioneering data trading practice in the field of intelligent vehicles and smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Street view images constitute an important part of urban computing, providing data support for tasks such as autonomous driving and landscape planning, and promoting the interaction and collaboration between machines and the urban environment. However, in current practice, the usability of street view images is hindered by low-light conditions, and existing low-light enhancement methods often overlook the high-frequency characteristics specific to street views. Therefore, this paper proposes a conditional diffusion model called SVBoost that incorporates high-frequency information and color balance to achieve targeted enhancement of street view images. The proposed model demonstrates favorable performance in terms of image quality, and the enhancement effect observed in semantic segmentation tasks suggests the potential of this method for downstream applications.",

    "abstract": "Since the invention of electrical energy, their consumption increased over time and nowadays, with electric cars and smart cities, the demand for electrical energy increased exponentially as the energy should be on 24/7, not only in the daylight as was in the past. Generally, electric cars transport people daily, and at night, connected to battery chargers fed by the AC mains. These revolutionary lifestyles are changing the electric demand. Nowadays we have found different ways to generate electrical energy (hydroelectric, thermoelectric, aeolian, solar); many of these central generations are far from consumer and use transmission lines to connect that, and transformers are used for almost all of that to increase or decrease voltage/current. Transformers are composed of three elements in their construction: copper winding, magnetic core, and oil. The oil used as insulation material for winding also cools down the device, transferring the heat from winding and magnetic core to the outside through the metal structure and circulating it by the convection process. In this work, we characterized the mineral oil voltage breakdown (BD) at room temperature as liquid insulators in transformers. On the pulsed condition, we reached a dielectric strength of order of 27.5 kV/mm, while under alternate current AC conditions, the dielectric strength was only around 5 kV/mm, testing with the same pair of electrodes. With the pulsed testing, the BD has a higher value due to less stress on the material than the AC 60 Hz continuous voltage application.",

    "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of educational technology, the imperative to introduce young learners to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a compelling and digestible manner has never been more critical. This paper delineates the novel Integrated Gamification-AI Learning Theory (IGALT), a pedagogical framework that synergizes gamification with AI education to foster engaging and effective learning experiences. At the heart of demonstrating IGALT's practical application is 'TransAI,' an inventive Lego-Transformer-like character that serves as an educational tool bridging sophisticated AI concepts with playful learning. Equipped with vision for environmental interaction, a brain for analytical processing, and additional modules like 'PetScada' for data gathering and 'Scooper' for action-based learning, TransAI exemplifies how gamification can make AI education accessible and captivating for children. Set within a smart city context, TransAI embarks on various missions that translate abstract AI concepts into concrete, hands-on experiences, thus enabling children to explore, understand, and apply AI in problem-solving. This educational approach not only ignites creativity and imagination but also instills a foundational understanding of AI, preparing young minds for future technological landscapes. By integrating IGALT with the TransAI platform, this paper proposes a groundbreaking method to acquaint the younger generation with AI, nurturing an early interest in STEM fields through an engaging, imaginative, and practical learning journey.",

However, conducting SLR can be a challenging task that is prone to errors and subjectivity. To mitigate these issues, text mining and machine learning (ML) techniques have been adopted. These techniques have been shown to improve the efficiency and quality of SLR. In this paper, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) to conduct a comprehensive SLR on developments within smart cities, using a 7-step methodology. Our results demonstrate that LDA and ML (ChatGPT, in this case) can enhance SLR, resulting in over 80% improvement in both the efficiency and quality of the review. Specifically, the results highlight the importance of a comprehensive framework for planning and managing sustainable smart city projects, including stakeholder-driven design of common applications and deployment of technologies to implement these applications. The interrelationships between these themes are crucial for achieving the vision of a smart city. This paper contributes twofold: (1) a 7-step SLR methodology that incorporates LDA and ChatGPT and (2) a comprehensive SLR on the smart city concept.",

Thus, these tools are being deployed in several ways to address societal issues and concerns for 'social good'. For instance, AI/ML has applicable use cases for crisis response, economic empowerment, educational demands, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, and security and justice. In this work, we seek to explore the power and capability of AI/ML in understanding citizens' engagement, which can improve governance and smart city deployment. Specifically, we studied the views expressed by online users about the city of Saskatoon in Canada. The analyzed views have become a value chain that community leaders can use to improve the governance structure of the city. In the study, we extracted 114,390 comments from Reddit (i.e., Saskatoon subreddit posts) between January 1, 2019, and September 20, 2023, to discover topics to highlight citizens' concerns. We compare the performance of three major topic models, namely, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and BERTopic with a K-means clustering algorithm in the discovery of topics from the collected Reddit comments. The BERTopic with the K-means clustering algorithm achieved the highest coherence score of approximately 0.64 in the extraction of 25 topics from the dataset. Our findings showed that BERTopic can discover coherent and diverse topics compared to LDA and NMF. We found 12 underlying themes by merging related topics. Also, we leveraged SiEBERT (a pre-trained transformer model), 4 supervised ML models, and VADER (a lexical sentiment analysis classifier) to identify the sentiments expressed in each theme. The SiEBERT model outperformed the other sentiment classifiers with an accuracy of 89% in the prediction of sentiments.

    "abstract": "The 3D virtual terrain generation is currently used in geography teaching and setting up relevant virtual scenes according to the teaching content, which can visually display the verification experimental conditions and results and enhance the universality of virtual geography experiments. In the field of digital twin smart city, traffic, and water simulation, constructing virtual terrain according to the real terrain can provide the basic environment for subsequent development and experiments. In military simulation, it can quickly build beyond the real scenes of extreme training environment, which has a key role in improving military training and enhancing combat capabilities. Hand-drawn feature sketches can express 3D virtual terrain under human subjective perception. Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details. This model is applied to the real natural landscape display and terrain evolution, and it can meet the user’s needs to obtain the virtual terrain with high realistic feeling after inputting the hand-drawn terrain feature sketch. This improved model proposed in this paper has good prospects for 3D terrain modeling and editing.",

In this paper, we pioneer the application of MLLMs to VQoSS change estimation, with our empirical findings affirming their effectiveness. In addition, we introduce Street Quality Generative Pre-trained Transformer (SQ-GPT), a model that distills knowledge from the current most powerful but inaccessible (not free) GPT-4V, requiring no human efforts. SQ-GPT approaches GPT-4V's performance and is viable for large-scale VQoSS change estimation. In a case study of Nanjing, we showcase the practicality of SQ-GPT and knowledge distillation pipeline.

However, the bottleneck in many computer vision applications lies in the limited availability of adequate datasets. One particular application that is of great importance for the safety of cities and crowded areas is smart surveillance. Conventional surveillance methods are reactive and often ineffective in enable real-time action. However, smart surveillance is a key component of smart and proactive security in a smart city. Motivated by a smart city application which aims at the automatic identification of concerning events for alerting law-enforcement and governmental agencies, we craft a large video dataset that focuses on the distinction between small-scale violence, large-scale violence, peaceful gatherings, and natural events. This dataset classifies public events along two axes, the size of the crowd observed and the level of perceived violence in the crowd. We name this newly-built dataset the Multi-Scale Violence and Public Gathering (MSV-PG) dataset. The videos in the dataset go through several pre-processing steps to prepare them to be fed into a deep learning architecture. We conduct several experiments on the MSV-PG datasets using a ResNet3D, a Swin Transformer and an R(2 + 1)D architecture. The results achieved by these models when trained on the MSV-PG dataset, 88.37%, 89.76%, and 89.3%, respectively, indicate that the dataset is well-labeled and is rich enough to train deep learning models for automatic smart surveillance for diverse scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The surge in the proliferation of private vehicles within urban centers has exacerbated challenges in parking management, primarily due to a scarcity of available spaces. To address this issue, the implementation of intelligent parking systems featuring autonomous monitoring and guidance has become imperative. This paper proposes a manual model of ResNet-50 and other classification networks using the Global Perceptual Feature Extractor (GPFE) module. Evaluated on established datasets, namely PKLot and CNREXT, the GPFE module significantly enhances accuracy and resilience when integrated with CNN classifiers like ResNet-50. Additionally, the methodology of the paper employs cost-effective cameras for binary classification across diverse lighting scenarios. This innovative decision eliminates the need for Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, leading to substantial reductions in maintenance expenses. The integration of this module not only enhances the precision of binary classification but also addresses cost-related challenges, establishing it as a sustainable solution for parking problems.",

This task is essential for applications such as video surveillance, and intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a Multi-details Vision Transformer (MD-ViT) approach for vehicle Re-ID. Our method leverages the power of transformers to handle multiple levels of detail in vehicle appearance, enabling more accurate and robust re-identification across diverse scenarios. We introduce a multiple details feature extraction process to capture fine-grained information, improving the model's ability to distinguish between vehicles with similar attributes. Furthermore, we incorporate attention mechanisms to focus on relevant vehicle details, enhancing the model's discriminative capabilities. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in vehicle Re-ID. Our transformer-based framework offers a promising direction for advancing vehicle re-identification with multiple details, with potential applications in smart cities, traffic monitoring, and security systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has impacted global economy, workforce productivity, smart health, smart cities, smart transport, and much more to come. Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, have been widely adopted in various applications. Blockchain Technology stands as a towering disruptor in today's tech landscape, offering assurances of enhanced security and scalability for various applications. Within the realm of healthcare, its adoption has surged, spanning from streamlined record-keeping to bolstered clinical trials, fortified medical supply chains, and vigilant patient monitoring. These applications harness the intrinsic attributes of blockchain to elevate standards of safety, privacy, and security within the healthcare sector. The combined power of AI and blockchain has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, ensuring improved security, transparency, and efficiency. Nevertheless, Porru et al. [1] have highlighted deficiencies in the processes, tools, and techniques within this domain. Hence, this paper aims to furnish a structured framework that ensures both security and sustainability in the development of healthcare blockchain applications.

    "abstract": "Automatic building detection from remote sensing images holds significant applications in various domains, including cartography, land-use change detection, urban planning, and 3D intelligent city construction. Driven by the innovation of deep learning technology, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for automatic interpretation, exhibiting hierarchical feature generation and robust representation for building extraction. However, the inherent computational limitations of convolutional operators hinder the acquisition of an effective global receptive field. Recent advancements in deep learning have witnessed the adoption of the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism by Transformer, presenting the superiority of global context construction. Nonetheless, this network structure encounters difficulties in effectively modelling two-dimensional spatial structure features with scale variation in semantic segmentation and often has huge parameters with high algorithm complexity. To address the above problems, this paper proposed a hybrid deep neural network synergistically harnessing the superiority of CNN and Transformer to extract buildings from remote sensing images. Meanwhile, an improved MHSA mechanism is developed to facilitate the construction of multiscale global representations, concurrently reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the cross-level MHSA modules the semantic correlation between the deep and shallow-level features to refine spatial fine-grained information. The proposed method was comprehensively evaluated on two building datasets via quantitative analysis and visualization. The experimental results confirmed that the developed network and modules outperform other state-of-the-art methods and can effectively improve the accuracy (93.4% F1-score on the WHU dataset, 89.38% F1-score on the CAMB dataset) with high efficiency for building extraction.",

    "abstract": "Sunlight and shadow play critical roles in how urban spaces are utilized, thrive, and grow. While access to sunlight is essential to the success of urban environments, shadows can provide shaded places to stay during the hot seasons, mitigate heat island effect, and increase pedestrian comfort levels. Properly quantifying sunlight access and shadows in large urban environments is key in tackling some of the important challenges facing cities today. In this paper, we propose Deep Umbra, a novel computational framework that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale. Our framework is based on a conditional generative adversarial network that considers the physical form of cities to compute high-resolution spatial information of accumulated sunlight access for the different seasons of the year. We use data from seven different cities to train our model, and show, through an extensive set of experiments, its low overall RMSE (below 0.1) as well as its extensibility to cities that were not part of the training set. Additionally, we contribute a set of case studies and a comprehensive dataset with sunlight access information for more than 100 cities across six continents of the world. Deep Umbra is available at <uri>http://urbantk.org/shadows</uri>.",

    "abstract": "The automation of surveillance systems, driven by the rapid development of computer vision technology, has significantly enhanced the analysis of surveillance videos, particularly in recognition of human activity, including behavior analysis and violence detection, thereby bolstering public and industrial security. Despite these advancements, detecting and analyzing violent actions remains challenging, especially for real-time surveillance systems with limited computing power. We propose an artificial intelligence-based framework called VD-Net (Violence Detection Network), enabled by Intelligent Internet-of-Things (IIoT) to detect violent behavior in public and private spaces. The model utilizes lightweight special task temporal convolutional network (ST-TCN) blocks and several bottleneck layers to focus on salient features in the input sequence. The learned features passed from the classifier to discriminate between violent and nonviolent actions. Additionally, our system is supposed to trigger an alert if violence is detected, which is then communicated to relevant departments. We checked the robustness of our system by surveillance and non-surveillance datasets and ensured a 1-4 % improvement in State-of-The-Art (SoTA) accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting is essential and challenging to intelligent city management and public safety. In this paper, we attempt to use a pure self-attention method in traffic flow forecasting. However, when dealing with input sequences, including large-scale regions' historical records, it is difficult for the self-attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant ones for forecasting. To address this issue, we design a progressive space-time self-attention mechanism named ProSTformer, which can reduce self-attention computation times from thousands to tens. Our design is based on two pieces of prior knowledge in the traffic flow forecasting literature: (i) spatiotemporal dependencies can be factorized into spatial and temporal dependencies; (ii) adjacent regions have more influences than distant regions, and temporal characteristics of closeness, period and trend are more important than crossed relations between them. Our ProSTformer has two characteristics. First, each block in ProSTformer highlights the unique dependencies, ProSTformer progressively focuses on spatial dependencies from local to global regions, on temporal dependencies from closeness, period and trend to crossed relations between them, and on external dependencies such as weather conditions, temperature and day-of-week. Second, we use the Tensor Rearranging technique to force the model to compute self-attention only to adjacent regions and to the unique temporal characteristic. Then, we use the Patch Merging technique to greatly reduce self-attention computation times to distant regions and crossed temporal relations. We evaluate ProSTformer on two traffic datasets and find that it performs better than sixteen baseline models. The code is available at https://github.com/yanxiao1930/ProSTformer_code/tree/main.",

Existing traffic flow prediction techniques using deep learning, mostly LSTMs, have achieved enormous success based on the large traffic flow datasets collected by governments and different organizations. Nevertheless, a lot of these datasets contain sensitive attributes that may relate to users’ private data. Hence, there is a need to develop an accurate traffic flow prediction mechanism that preserves users’ privacy. To address this challenge, we propose a federated learning-based temporal fusion transformer framework for traffic flow prediction which is a distributed machine learning approach where all the model updates are aggregated through an aggregation algorithm rather than sharing and storing the raw data in one centralized location. The proposed framework trains the data locally on client devices using temporal fusion transformers and differential privacy. Experiments show that the proposed framework can guarantee accuracy in predicting traffic flow for both the short and long term.",

This artificial dataset enhances our new 5GT-GAN-NET-based prediction model. The result is a significant boost in prediction accuracy, with Mean Square Error (MSE) reduced to 0.000346 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to 0.00685. Compared to benchmarks, our model improves MSE and MAE by up to 95.45% with respect to the ARIMA model and 87.31% with respect to the NARNN model respectively. User privacy remains a cornerstone of our approach, crucial for smart city applications. Our predictive capabilities enable more efficient resource allocation by service providers, increasing communication infrastructure reliability. Although tailored for smart cities, the approach is adaptable to other fields facing data scarcity and privacy concerns. Our research highlights the potential of GANs in generating large, accurate datasets for traffic prediction in 5G environments while prioritizing user privacy.",

    "abstract": "Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) have recently emerged as a crucial technology in the Internet of Things (IoT), with widespread applications in smart cities and homes. Radio frequency-based fingerprinting, enabling location estimation through signal observations, requires manual surveys for constructing location maps. This process involves annotating radio signatures with corresponding locations, rendering it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, our paper proposes a data augmentation method that leverages a conditional generative adversarial network with LSTM and CNN. This approach effectively captures patterns in the training data, generating synthetic data that aligns with the distribution. Experiments in a real scenario demonstrate an average localization error of 1.966 and 1.218 m for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low energy (BLE), surpassing traditional fingerprinting and comparable to the baseline data augmentation methods.",

    "abstract": "Fast and high-precision urban scene 3D modeling is the foundational data infrastructure for the digital earth and smart cities. However, due to challenges such as water-area matching difficulties and issues like data redundancy and insufficient observations, existing full-automatic 3D modeling methods often result in water-area missing and many small holes in the models and insufficient local-model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, full-automatic high-precision scene 3D reconstruction method with water-area intelligent complementation on depth maps and mesh optimization is proposed. Firstly, SfM was used to calculated image poses and PatchMatch was used to generated initial depth maps. Secondly, a simplified GAN extracted water-area masks and ray tracing was used achieve high-precision auto-completed water-area depth values. Thirdly, fully connected CRF optimized water-areas and arounds in depth maps. Fourthly, high-precision 3D point clouds were obtained using depth map fusion based on clustering culling and depth least squares. Then, mesh was generated and optimized using similarity measurement and vertex gradients to obtain refined mesh. Finally, high-precision scene 3D models without water-area missing or holes were generated.

    "abstract": "Significance Optical fiber sensors play an increasingly important role in safety monitoring areas in the smart Internet of Things (IoT). Particularly, a fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensor (fiber-optic DAS) based on the phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Φ‑OTDR) technology provides a highly dense, cost-effective, and continuous environment measurement way over a wide range. All kinds of vibration sources can be sensed and located with high sensitivity and precision utilizing the widely laid ordinary telecommunication cables, and thus fiber-optic DAS has been applied in various ground listening applications, such as natural disaster prediction of ocean-floor seismic activity, volcanic events, and earthquake, energy exploration in oil and gas industry, and civil infrastructure monitoring in the pipelines, railways, and perimeters. It leads to a new generation of large-scale fiber-optic IoT for ground and underwater listening technology. From the current research status in China and abroad, DAS is becoming mature in its hardware performance, such as the demodulation fidelity, sensing distance, detection bandwidth, and sensitivity, which are all approaching their perfection. However, with the rapid advance of DAS applications, the complicated and ever-changing environments for large-scale monitoring have brought about challenges of high false alarm rates due to its advantages of high sensitivity. It is difficult to achieve high-precision detection, recognition, and positioning of perceived vibration and acoustic targets, which has become the biggest technical bottleneck restricting the large-scale application of DAS technology. In recent years, driven by the development of advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the signal processing methods of fully intelligent DAS with high accuracy and real-time performance in practical complex environments have become a research hotspot and focus in the field of fiber-optic sensing. The signal processing method in DAS plays a crucial and decisive role in improving the intelligent perception ability of the entire system. Progress We review the current research status of signal processing methods in smart fiber-optic DAS entering the deep learning stage, from mainstream supervised learning to unsupervised, semi-supervised, and transfer learning, from single-source detection to multi-source aliasing detection, and from single-task recognition or localization to simultaneous implementation of recognition and localization tasks, and we predict possible research directions for further improving the intelligent processing performance and perception ability of DAS in the future. Firstly, the typical fiber-optic DAS system structure and its vibration/sound sensing mechanism (Fig. 2), and the smart DAS and its signal processing architecture in smart city monitoring applications (Fig. 3) are introduced. Then, the signal processing methods based on deep learning are explained in detail, which includes the main stream of supervised learning methods based on multi-dimensional information extraction, and semi-supervised, unsupervised learning, and cross-scene transfer learning methods in DAS. For the supervised learning method, it includes DAS signal recognition models based on temporal information extraction, such as one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) (Fig. 4), multi-scale convolutional neural networks (MS-CNNs) (Fig. 5), multi-scale and contextual temporal relationship mining methods (Figs. 6-7), and the two-dimensional recognition models based on time-frequency (Figs. 8-11), time-space (Figs. 12-14), and space-frequency (Fig. 15) information extraction technologies. Besides, some other supervised methods are also included, for example, recognition models based on attention-based long short-term memory (Fig. 16) and the fusion of manual features and deep features. It proves that the combination of traditional empirical rules and deep learning networks can further reduce the false alarm rate of the system. In response to the problem of insufficient labeled samples in new scenarios in practical applications, several semi-supervised recognition methods based on the 1D-SSGAN (one-dimensional semi-supervised generative adversarial network), SSAE (sparse stacked autoencoder), and FixMatch models have been involved to achieve accurate recognition of DAS signals with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, the SNN-based DAS unsupervised learning network (Fig. 17) and the cross-scene transfer learning network based on AlexNet+SVM (Fig. 18) also appear to improve the generalization ability of DAS signal recognition methods. In order to evaluate the performance of these recognition models, we introduce seven indicators for evaluating the recognition accuracy and four indicators for the processing time of the algorithms. The above key DAS recognition methods and their performance are statistically compared in Table 2. At last, the new challenges of smart DAS sensing, from single-source detection to multi-source aliasing detection, from target recognition to localization, and from a single task to multi-task processing, as well as other methods to enhance its intelligent perception capabilities, have also been introduced. Conclusions and Prospects Further improvement of signal processing and its sensing capabilities still faces new challenges and opportunities and will open a new chapter in fully intelligent DAS. Stable, accurate, real-time, and efficient signal recognition in DAS in new complicated application scenarios remains a research hotspot in the field of distributed fiber-optic sensing in the future, including: 1) improving the generalization ability of DAS recognition models in cross scenarios; 2) significant improvement in real-time processing capabilities in DAS; 3) improvement of multi-task processing ability in DAS; 4) implementation of high-performance on-chip DAS.",

It is difficult to achieve high-precision detection, recognition, and positioning of perceived vibration and acoustic targets, which has become the biggest technical bottleneck restricting the large-scale application of DAS technology. In recent years, driven by the development of advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the signal processing methods of fully intelligent DAS with high accuracy and real-time performance in practical complex environments have become a research hotspot and focus in the field of fiber-optic sensing. The signal processing method in DAS plays a crucial and decisive role in improving the intelligent perception ability of the entire system. Progress We review the current research status of signal processing methods in smart fiber-optic DAS entering the deep learning stage, from mainstream supervised learning to unsupervised, semi-supervised, and transfer learning, from single-source detection to multi-source aliasing detection, and from single-task recognition or localization to simultaneous implementation of recognition and localization tasks, and we predict possible research directions for further improving the intelligent processing performance and perception ability of DAS in the future. Firstly, the typical fiber-optic DAS system structure and its vibration/sound sensing mechanism (Fig. 2), and the smart DAS and its signal processing architecture in smart city monitoring applications (Fig. 3) are introduced. Then, the signal processing methods based on deep learning are explained in detail, which includes the main stream of supervised learning methods based on multi-dimensional information extraction, and semi-supervised, unsupervised learning, and cross-scene transfer learning methods in DAS. For the supervised learning method, it includes DAS signal recognition models based on temporal information extraction, such as one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) (Fig. 4), multi-scale convolutional neural networks (MS-CNNs) (Fig. 5), multi-scale and contextual temporal relationship mining methods (Figs. 6-7), and the two-dimensional recognition models based on time-frequency (Figs. 8-11), time-space (Figs. 12-14), and space-frequency (Fig. 15) information extraction technologies. Besides, some other supervised methods are also included, for example, recognition models based on attention-based long short-term memory (Fig. 16) and the fusion of manual features and deep features. It proves that the combination of traditional empirical rules and deep learning networks can further reduce the false alarm rate of the system. In response to the problem of insufficient labeled samples in new scenarios in practical applications, several semi-supervised recognition methods based on the 1D-SSGAN (one-dimensional semi-supervised generative adversarial network), SSAE (sparse stacked autoencoder), and FixMatch models have been involved to achieve accurate recognition of DAS signals with a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, the SNN-based DAS unsupervised learning network (Fig. 17) and the cross-scene transfer learning network based on AlexNet+SVM (Fig. 18) also appear to improve the generalization ability of DAS signal recognition methods.",

    "abstract": "Semantic image synthesis, a pivotal task in image-to-image translation, has been widely addressed using generative adversarial network (GAN) models. However, existing GAN-based approaches often suffer from inadequate incorporation of structural and spatial information, resulting in unsatisfactory quality of the synthesized images and a pronounced disparity between photo-realistic and generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based methodology to address these limitations, enabling the generation of high-resolution images from semantic label maps while bridging the quality gap and preserving detailed information in the generated outputs. The proposed approach leverages a two-step process, starting with a local binary pattern convolutional generator that produces a local binary pattern feature map. Subsequently, a global convolutional generator is fed with the segmentation map and the feature map through a learned modulation scheme facilitated by a multi-feature adaptive denormalization layer (MFADE) during the training process to generate photo-realistic images. Extensive experiments using Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO-stuff datasets validate the performance of our proposed method and showcase its accuracy and robustness in addressing semantic image synthesis tasks, thereby paving the way for its potential applications in enhancing urban sensing and data analytics in Smart Cities.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds provides foundational knowledge for various geodetic and cartographic applications, including autonomous driving, smart cities, and indoor navigation. However, point cloud data's unstructured and inherently disordered characteristics pose challenges in extracting accurate 3-D semantic information. In this study, we introduce a novel semantic segmentation network for large-scale point cloud scenes, referred to as dense dual-branch cross attention network (D2CAN). We propose a local multidimensional feature aggregation (LMFA) module to increase multidimensional feature representation types and preserve rich local details. Based on the augmented local features, an expanded dual-branch cross attention (EDCA) module establishes internal deep connections between multidimensional attributes and semantic features. This assists the network in reducing boundary ambiguities and expanding the receptive field, enabling the parallel capture of long-range contexts specifically adapted for large-scale scene point cloud segmentation. These two modules work collaboratively to constitute a local context deep perception (LCDP) block. To reduce information loss during feature sampling and propagation, we propose a global feature pyramid dense fusion (GFDF) block. This block adaptively integrates features across different scales and effectively captures global context with long-range dependencies. In conclusion, D2CAN combines LCDP and GFDF to aggregate both local and global contexts, resulting in robust feature discrimination for semantic segmentation of large-scale scenes. Our method's effectiveness and superior generation ability have been validated across three challenging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Toronto-3D, SensatUrban, and Stanford large-scale 3-D indoor spaces (S3DIS) datasets, with mean intersection over union (IoU) values of 83.5%, 61.1%, and 72.3%, respectively.",

Such problems not only exist in the traditional deep learning field, but also exist in criminal investigation, scientific photography and other fields, such as the accuracy of low-light image.

This method uses brightness attention mechanism to predict the illumination distribution of low-light image and guides the enhancement network to enhance the image adaptiveness in different luminance regions.

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has gradually become an effective e-government process to gather citizen complaints over the implementation of various public services. In practice, the collected complaints form a massive dataset, making it difficult for government officers to analyze the big data effectively. It is consequently vital to use data mining algorithms to classify the citizen complaint data for efficient follow-up actions. However, different classification algorithms produce varied classification accuracies. Thus, this study aimed to compare the accuracy of several classification algorithms on crowdsourced citizen complaint data. Taking the case of the LAKSA app in Tangerang City, Indonesia, this study included k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost for the accuracy assessment. The data were taken from crowdsourced citizen complaints submitted to the LAKSA app, including those aggregated from official social media channels, from May 2021 to April 2022. The results showed SVM with a linear kernel as the most accurate among the assessed algorithms (89.2%). In contrast, AdaBoost (base learner: Decision Trees) produced the lowest accuracy. Still, the accuracy levels of all algorithms varied in parallel to the amount of training data available for the actual classification categories. Overall, the assessments on all algorithms indicated that their accuracies were insignificantly different, with an overall variation of 4.3%. The AdaBoost-based classification, in particular, showed its large dependence on the choice of base learners. Looking at the method and results, this study contributes to e-government, data mining, and big data discourses. This research recommends that governments continuously conduct supervised training of classification algorithms over their crowdsourced citizen complaints to seek the highest accuracy possible, paving the way for smart and sustainable governance.",

    "abstract": "Bird’s eye view (BEV) semantic maps have evolved into a crucial element of urban intelligent traffic management and monitoring, offering invaluable visual and significant data representations for informed intelligent city decision making. Nevertheless, current methodologies continue underutilizing the temporal information embedded within dynamic frames throughout the BEV feature transformation process. This limitation results in decreased accuracy when mapping high-speed moving objects, particularly in capturing their shape and dynamic trajectory. A framework is proposed for cross-view semantic segmentation to address this challenge, leveraging simulated environments as a starting point before applying it to real-life urban imaginative transportation scenarios. The view converter module is thoughtfully designed to collate information from multiple initial view observations captured from various angles and modes. This module outputs a top-down view semantic graph characterized by its object space layout to preserve beneficial temporal information in BEV transformation. The NuScenes dataset is used to evaluate model effectiveness. A novel application is also devised that harnesses transformer networks to map images and video sequences into top-down or comprehensive bird’s-eye views. By combining physics-based and constraint-based formulations and conducting ablation studies, the approach has been substantiated, highlighting the significance of context above and below a given point in generating these maps. This innovative method has been thoroughly validated on the NuScenes dataset. Notably, it has yielded state-of-the-art instantaneous mapping results, with particular benefits observed for smaller dynamic category displays. The experimental findings include comparing axial attention with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, demonstrating the performance enhancement associated with temporal awareness.",

    "abstract": "Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and one of the main drivers behind global warming and climate change. In spite of the global economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global average atmospheric CO 2 concentration reached a new record high in 2020 with its year-on-year increase being the fifth highest annual increase in 63 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Furthermore, the years 2020 and 2019 were respectively the second and third warmest, while the decade 2010–2019 was the warmest decade ever recorded. In an attempt to curb this climate emergency, many countries and organizations globally have adopted ambitious goals and announced plans to help dramatically reduce CO 2 emissions. As part of these plans, various innovative smart city projects are being developed, focusing on implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. By collecting sensor-based data, such technologies aim towards automating data-driven decision-making around carbon emission management and reduction. In this work, a hybrid machine learning system, aimed at forecasting CO 2 concentration levels in a smart city environment was developed using a multivariate time series dataset containing IoT sensor measurements of CO 2 , as well as various environmental factors, taken at every second. The proposed system demonstrated superior performance to similar methods, while also maintaining a high degree of interpretability. More specifically, the approach was empirically compared against other similar approaches in several scenarios and use cases, thus also offering more insight into the predictive capabilities of such state-of-the-art systems. For this comparison, both traditional time series and deep learning approaches were employed, including the current state-of-the-art architectures, such as attention-based, transformer networks. Results demonstrated that, when measured across various settings and metrics, including three different forecasting horizons, the hybrid solution achieved the best overall results, and in some cases, the difference in performance was statistically significant. At the same time, insights from the system’s inner workings were extracted, shedding light on the reasoning behind the model’s predictions and the factors that contribute to them, thus showcasing its transparency. Lastly, throughout the experiments, deep learning approaches illustrated their ability to better handle the multivariate nature of the dataset and in general tended to outperform the traditional time series methods, especially for longer forecasting horizons.",

Based on a dataset with more than 10 million GPS trajectory records collected by mobile sensors, this research proposed a CNN-BiLSTM-VAE-ATT-based encoder-decoder model for fine-grained individual activity sequence prediction. The model combines the long-term and short-term dependencies crosswise and also considers randomness, diversity, and uncertainty of individual activity patterns. The proposed results show higher accuracy compared to the ten baselines. The model can generate high diversity results while approximating the original activity patterns distribution. Moreover, the model also has interpretability in revealing the time dependency importance of the activity pattern prediction.",

However, existing works have limitations in capturing spatial information, though the surrounding environment plays a critical role in mobile traffic prediction. In this paper, we utilize a spatial knowledge graph to represent spatial information and add important urban components to augment it making it a more effective tool for capturing environmental information. we further propose a multi-relational knowledge graph convolutional network model for mobile traffic prediction, which consists of three parts. The environmental context modelling captures spatial information from the augmented spatial knowledge graph using tucker decomposition and relational graph convolutional network. The semantic relationship modelling extracts semantic relationships between base stations and employs transformer and causal convolution to capture temporal features. The inter-attentional fusion modelling utilizes the self-attention mechanism to further capture base station relationships and predict future traffic volumes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models by over 10% in mobile traffic prediction.

    "abstract": "One of the major problems that cause continual trouble in deep learning networks is that training a large network requires massive labelled datasets. The preparation of a massive labelled dataset is a cumbersome task and requires lot of human interventions. This paper proposes a novel generator network ‘Sim2Real’ transfer is a recent and fast-developing field in machine learning used to bridge the gap between simulated and real data. Training with simulated datasets often converges due to its size but fails to generalize real-world applications. Simulated datasets can be used to train and test deep learning models, enables the development and evaluation of new algorithms and architectures. By simulating road dataset, researchers can generate large amounts of realistic road-traffic dataset that can be used to study and understand several problems such as vehicular object tracking and classification, traffic situation analysis etc. The main advantage of such a transfer algorithm is to use the abundance of a simulated dataset to generate huge realistic-looking datasets to solve data-intense tasks. This work presents a novel, robust sim2real algorithm that converts the labels of a semantic segmentation map to a realistic-looking street view using the Cityscapes dataset and aims to achieve robust urban mobility for smart cities. Further, the generalizability of the Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) architecture was tested by using an origami robot dataset for sim2real transfer. We show that the results were found to be qualitatively satisfactory for different traffic analysis applications. In addition, road perception was done using a lightweight SVM pipeline and evaluated on the KITTI dataset. We have incorporated Cycle Consistency Loss and Identity Loss as the metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed Cycle GAN model. We inferred that the proposed Cycle GAN model provides an Identity loss of less than 0.2 in both the Cityscapes dataset and KITTI datasets. Also, we understand that the super-pixel resolution has a good impact on the quantitative results of the proposed Cycle GAN models.",

To address this limitation, this paper introduces HDRFormer, an innovative framework designed to enhance high dynamic range (HDR) image quality in edge–cloud-based video surveillance systems. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, HDRFormer employs a unique architecture comprising a feature extraction module (FEM) and a weighted attention module (WAM). The FEM leverages a transformer-based hierarchical structure to adeptly capture multi-scale image information. In addition, the guided filters are utilized to steer the network, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the images. On the other hand, the WAM focuses on reconstructing saturated areas, improving the perceptual quality of the images, and rendering the reconstructed HDR images with naturalness and color saturation. Extensive experiments on multiple HDR image reconstruction datasets demonstrate HDRFormer’s substantial improvements, achieving up to a 2.7 dB increase in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and an enhancement of 0.09 in the structural similarity (SSIM) compared to existing methods. In addition, the framework exhibits outstanding performance in multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and HDR visual difference predictor (HDR-VDP2.2). The proposed method not only outperforms the existing HDR reconstruction techniques but also offers better generalization capabilities, laying a robust foundation for future applications in smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian gender classification (PGC) is a key task in full-body-based pedestrian image analysis and has become an important area in applications like content-based image retrieval, visual surveillance, smart city, and demographic collection. In the last decade, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have appeared with great potential and with reliable choices for vision tasks, such as object classification, recognition, detection, etc. But CNN has a limited local receptive field that prevents them from learning information about the global context. In contrast, a vision transformer (ViT) is a better alternative to CNN because it utilizes a self-attention mechanism to attend to a different patch of an input image. In this work, generic and effective modules such as locality self-attention (LSA), and shifted patch tokenization (SPT)-based vision transformer model are explored for the PGC task. With the use of these modules in ViT, it is successfully able to learn from stretch even on small-size (SS) datasets and overcome the lack of locality inductive bias.

    "abstract": "The conventional approaches for traffic intensity (TI) detection in smart cities use specialized sensors, such as loop detectors, cameras, and radar. These sensors come with high costs, limited reuse, and specialized maintenance. Thus, we propose the utilization of general-purpose sensing, which involves the use of cost-effective and easily deployable sensors, such as microphones, and air quality sensors that are cheaper, reusable, and easily manageable sensors. A general-purpose sensing infrastructure can be used for several applications including measuring TI. The main objective of this letter is to demonstrate how noise signatures can be leveraged to measure TI. Traditionally, image classification techniques are used for audio data analysis and vision-transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable results in this area. However, there is limited research that explores ViT models for traffic intensity detection. For TI detection, two approaches: vehicle count prediction and vehicle type detection (VTD), which use ViT models, are proposed. VTD approach performed better and it achieved an F1-score of 0.95 and a mean vehicle counting error of 0.032. In addition, the computational complexity of the approach was evaluated by implementing an edge solution. The proposed approaches can be effectively used even on resource-limited edge devices, with a notable increase in detection time.",

    "abstract": "Assigning detailed use categories to buildings is a challenging and relevant task in urban land use classification with applications in urban planning, digital city modelling and twinning. This study aims to provide the categorisation of buildings with detailed use information by considering the possibilities of mixed-use. Mixed-use combines different use forms, and serves as a new type of use category. We obtain attributive information by combining satellite imagery that reflects spatial information and textual information from publicly available point-of-interest data collected by citizens and available on online maps. We propose a multimodal transformer-based building-use classification method to capture and fuse these different data sources within an end-to-end learning workflow. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on four urban areas in China. Experiments show that the proposed method effectively maps building use according to eight types of fine-grain categories, with a Micro F1 score equal to 80.9%, and a Macro F1 score equal to 62% for Wuhan research area. The proposed method is able to harness the relationship between the features obtained from the different data sources and results in higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art fusion-based multimodal integration methods. The proposed method can effectively increase the attributive grain of building use resulting in high classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Traffic prediction is an important part of smart city management. Accurate traffic prediction can be deployed in urban applications such as congestion alerting and route planning, thus providing sustainable services to the public or relevant departments. Although some improvements have been made in existing traffic prediction methods, there are challenges due to the following: (1) Time series has multi-scale nature, that is, from different scale time ranges, traffic flow changes show different trends; (2) Spatial heterogeneity, meaning that traffic conditions in similar functional areas are usually similar. This task remains difficult. To address the above challenges, we propose a new spatial-temporal prediction method, namely Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Aware Transformer (MSSTAT), which is a Transformer architecture with multi-scale characteristics. Specifically, compared to the input of encoder, the input of different decoder layers has different scale information, MSSTAT synchronizes model the connection between time steps and scale information by a kind of Parallel Cross Multi-Head Attention, which gives each time step several times the perceived field while also being able to weaken the impact brought by anomaly point. In addition, to add connections between regions with similar functions, we map the traffic data of each node as a probability distribution and then measure the similarity between the nodes by the Wasserstein Distance, which leads to our proposed spatial-temporal aware adjacency matrix. Experimental results on four traffic flow datasets show that MSSTAT outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline.",

    "abstract": "Smart cities are designed to satisfy the needs of residents and improve their quality of life by providing a wide range of smart city services. One of the keys to the efficient operation of smart city services is the accurate forecast of the missing Quality of Service (QoS). Presently, many approaches utilize the context information of users and services, such as geographic location and network location, to somewhat increase the prediction accuracy and forecast the missing QoS values. However, because the network conditions and server status are unpredictable, time is also considered as one of the important factors affecting QoS prediction, which brings more challenges as follows: higher data dimension, more complex data characteristics, and higher data sparsity. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for time-aware Web service QoS prediction based on contrastive learning (named CLpred). CLpred utilizes a sequential data input format for QoS data and models these QoS sequences through transformer encoder with CLpred framework. Therefore, it can downscale QoS data and extract a more efficient representation in complex QoS data. Furthermore, it makes it possible to apply data augmentation methods to address the problems of data sparsity. In order to prove the superiority of the proposed approach, particularly inside the presence of extremely high-data sparsity, extensive experiments are conducted on the well-known service QoS data set WSDREAM.",

Among the various basic units carrying urban functions, residential community plays a vital part for supporting human life. Therefore, the layout planning of residential community has always been of concern, and has attracted particular attention since the advent of deep learning that facilitates the automated layout generation and spatial pattern recognition. However, the research circles generally suffer from the insufficiency of residential community layout benchmark or high-quality datasets, which hampers the future exploration of data-driven methods for residential community layout planning. The lack of datasets is largely due to the difficulties of large-scale real-world residential data acquisition and long-term expert screening. In order to address the issues and advance a benchmark dataset for various intelligent spatial design and analysis applications in the development of smart city, we introduce Residential Community Layout Planning (ReCo) Dataset, which is the first and largest open-source vector dataset related to real-world community to date. ReCo Dataset is presented in multiple data formats with 37,646 residential community layout plans, covering 598,728 residential buildings with height information. ReCo can be conveniently adapted for residential community layout related urban design tasks, e.g., generative layout design, morphological pattern recognition and spatial evaluation. To validate the utility of ReCo in automated residential community layout planning, two Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generative models are further applied to the dataset. We expect ReCo Dataset to inspire more creative and practical work in intelligent design and beyond.

    "abstract": "Long term dependency capture is essentially important for time series prediction and spatial–temporal forecasting. In recent years, many deep learning-based forecasting methods have been proposed, leading to rapid development in this area. We systematically reviewed long-term dependency capture methods, including temporal dependency in sequence (named intra-sequence temporal dependency), temporal dependency out of sequence (named inter-sequence temporal dependency, in this scenario the long-term dependencies are split by many subsequences). Because the batch technique is widely adopted in machine learning and deep learning, the range of temporal capturing ability for many proposed methods is intra-sequence temporal dependency, which limits the capacity of long-term dependency capture. Aiming at the above problems, we designed three type memory mechanisms (i.e., a temporal encoding memory mechanism, a cross-sequence memory mechanism and a query-key based memory mechanism) to solve those long term dependency problems. Moreover, based on the cross-sequence memory mechanism and query-key architecture, an Attention-based Long-Term Dependency Capture model (ALTDC) is proposed for long-term dependency modeling and further solves the temporal dependency coherence problem. ALTDC includes temporal Transformer and spatial Transformer. The temporal Transformer adopts multi-head attention mechanism in temporal dimension and takes into consideration the relative position encoding. The spatial Transformer leverages attention mechanism in spatial dimension, and utilizes learnable position encoding and graph convolution to capture spatial relationships. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-art baselines on real world time-series datasets and spatial–temporal datasets.",

    "abstract": "In the era of information explosion, spatio-temporal data mining serves as a critical part of urban management. Considering the various fields demanding attention, e.g., traffic state, human activity, and social event, predicting multiple spatio-temporal attributes simultaneously can alleviate regulatory pressure and foster smart city construction. However, current research can not handle the spatio-temporal multi-attribute prediction well due to the complex relationships between diverse attributes. The key challenge lies in how to address the common spatio-temporal patterns while tackling their distinctions. In this paper, we propose an effective solution for spatio-temporal multi-attribute prediction, PromptST. We devise a spatio-temporal transformer and a parameter-sharing training scheme to address the common knowledge among different spatiotemporal attributes. Then, we elaborate a spatio-temporal prompt tuning strategy to fit the specific attributes in a lightweight manner. Through the pretrain and prompt tuning phases, our PromptST is able to enhance the specific spatio-temoral characteristic capture by prompting the backbone model to fit the specific target attribute while maintaining the learned common knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify that our PromptST attains state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also prove PromptST owns good transferability on unseen spatio-temporal attributes, which brings promising application potential in urban computing. The implementation code is available to ease reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "In Smart City and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems, acquiring pedestrians' accurate locations is crucial to traffic and pedestrian safety. Current systems adopt cameras and wireless sensors to estimate people's locations via sensor fusion. Standard fusion algorithms, however, become inapplicable when multi-modal data is not associated. For example, pedestrians are out of the camera field of view, or data from the camera modality is missing. To address this challenge and produce more accurate location estimations for pedestrians, we propose a localization solution based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. During training, it learns the underlying linkage between pedestrians' camera-phone data correspondences. During inference, it generates refined position estimations based only on pedestrians' phone data that consists of GPS, IMU, and FTM. Results show that our GAN produces 3D coordinates at 1 to 2 meters localization error across 5 different outdoor scenes. We further show that the proposed model supports self-learning. The generated coordinates can be associated with pedestrians' bounding box coordinates to obtain additional camera-phone data correspondences. This allows automatic data collection during inference. Results show that after fine-tuning the GAN model on the expanded dataset, localization accuracy is further improved by up to 26%.",

    "abstract": "Tracking subjects in videos is one of the most widely used functions in camera-based IoT applications such as security surveillance, smart city traffic safety enhancement, vehicle to pedestrian communication and so on. In computer vision domain, tracking is usually achieved by first detecting subjects, then associating detected bounding boxes across video frames. Typically, frames are transmitted to a remote site for processing, incurring high latency and network costs. To address this, we propose ViFiT, a transformer-based model that reconstructs vision bounding box trajectories from phone data (IMU and Fine Time Measurements). It leverages a transformer's ability of better modeling long-term time series data. ViFiT is evaluated on Vi-Fi Dataset, a large-scale multimodal dataset in 5 diverse real world scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments. Results demonstrate that ViFiT outperforms the state-of-the-art approach for cross-modal reconstruction in LSTM Encoder-Decoder architecture X-Translator and achieves a high frame reduction rate as 97.76% with IMU and Wi-Fi data.",

    "abstract": "In the context of promoting the integration of smart cities, the pace of construction of smart chemical parks is gradually accelerating. Since accidents in China’s chemical industry have occurred frequently in recent years, causing great damage and loss to public safety, improving the safety management and emergency response capability of chemical parks is an urgent need to be solved. For this kind of safety problems, this paper proposed a game patrol strategy for hazardous gas leakage in chemical parks. Firstly, the convective diffusion model was used to describe the process of hazardous gas leakage. Secondly, game theory was introduced to model the confrontation process between the attacking and defending parties in the patrol problem, and the response time of the defenders to a safety incident was correlated with its benefit. Then, a multilinear programming-based GGC algorithm was proposed to solve this game model. Finally, the gains of the game model in this paper were compared with the other two basic methods in the scenarios of three real chemical park case with different sizes. The results show that the model can effectively improve the gains of the defender and reduce the gains of the attacker.",

    "abstract": "Tourism is vital for most historical and cultural cities. In the context of Smart Cities, there are numerous data sources in tourism domain that could be analyzed to monitor and forecast a range of different indicators related to touristic locations and attractions. In this paper, we propose a framework which exploits social media and big data to forecast both online reputation and touristic attraction presences. To this end, some techniques have been tested and proposed on the basis of machine learning, deep learning, causality assessment and explainable Artificial Intelligence, so as to provide evidence of the relevant variables for each prediction and estimation. An approach has been introduced to analyze the explainability of the proposed solutions, i.e., a multilingual sentiment analysis tool for social media data based on transformers to compare data sources as Trip Advisor and Twitter. Furthermore, causality analysis has been performed to evaluate the temporal impact of social media posts and other factors with respect to the number of presences. The work has been developed in the context of Herit-Data, a European Commission funded project on the exploitation of big data for tourism management and based on the Snap4City infrastructure and platform. Herit-Data has developed solutions for 6 major European touristic locations. In this paper, some of the solutions developed for Florence, Italy and Pont du Gard, France, are reported.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) play a crucial role in enhancing urban mobility within the context of a smarter and more connected urban environment. Three-dimensional object detection in AVs is an essential task for comprehending the driving environment to contribute to their safe use in urban environments. Existing 3D LiDAR object detection systems lose many critical point features during the down-sampling process and neglect the crucial interactions between local features, providing insufficient semantic information and leading to subpar detection performance. We propose a dynamic feature abstraction with self-attention (DFA-SAT), which utilizes self-attention to learn semantic features with contextual information by incorporating neighboring data and focusing on vital geometric details. DFA-SAT comprises four modules: object-based down-sampling (OBDS), semantic and contextual feature extraction (SCFE), multi-level feature re-weighting (MLFR), and local and global features aggregation (LGFA). The OBDS module preserves the maximum number of semantic foreground points along with their spatial information. SCFE learns rich semantic and contextual information with respect to spatial dependencies, refining the point features. MLFR decodes all the point features using a channel-wise multi-layered transformer approach. LGFA combines local features with decoding weights for global features using matrix product keys and query embeddings to learn spatial information across each channel. Extensive experiments using the KITTI dataset demonstrate significant improvements over the mainstream methods SECOND and PointPillars, improving the mean average precision (AP) by 6.86% and 6.43%, respectively, on the KITTI test dataset. DFA-SAT yields better and more stable performance for medium and long distances with a limited impact on real-time performance and model parameters, ensuring a transformative shift akin to when automobiles replaced conventional transportation in cities.",

    "abstract": "Fire-detection technology plays a critical role in ensuring public safety and facilitating the development of smart cities. Early fire detection is imperative to mitigate potential hazards and minimize associated losses. However, existing vision-based fire-detection methods exhibit limited generalizability and fail to adequately consider the effect of fire object size on detection accuracy. To address this issue, in this study a decoder-free fully transformer-based (DFFT) detector is used to achieve early smoke and flame detection, improving the detection performance for fires of different sizes. This method effectively captures multi-level and multi-scale fire features with rich semantic information while using two powerful encoders to maintain the accuracy of the single-feature map prediction. First, data augmentation is performed to enhance the generalizability of the model. Second, the detection-oriented transformer (DOT) backbone network is treated as a single-layer fire-feature extractor to obtain fire-related features on four scales, which are then fed into an encoder-only single-layer dense prediction module. Finally, the prediction module aggregates the multi-scale fire features into a single feature map using a scale-aggregated encoder (SAE). The prediction module then aligns the classification and regression features using a task-aligned encoder (TAE) to ensure the semantic interaction of the classification and regression predictions. Experimental results on one private dataset and one public dataset demonstrate that the adopted DFFT possesses high detection accuracy and a strong generalizability for fires of different sizes, particularly early small fires. The DFFT achieved mean average precision (mAP) values of 87.40% and 81.12% for the two datasets, outperforming other baseline models. It exhibits a better detection performance on flame objects than on smoke objects because of the prominence of flame features.",

In this paper, a novel Spatial-Temporal Guided Multi-graph Sandwich-Transformer (STGMT) is suggested to address the ubiquitous spatial-temporal heterogeneity in traffic demand forecasting.

The STE guides the attention mechanism, maintaining a unique parameter space for spatial-temporal nodes and enabling the learning of node-specific patterns. In STGMT, we develop Multi-head Temporal Attention (MTA) and Multi-head Temporal Interactive Attention (MTIA) for extracting temporal features, while Multi-head Spatial Attention (MSA) is employed for extracting spatial features. Furthermore, MSA incorporates both the accessibility graph determined by road topology and the similarity graph determined by specific traffic events to characterize the pairwise relationships among spatial nodes. Various attentions and feed-forward layers are rearranged and combined to form the Sandwich-Transformer. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets of node-level tasks of two different types (highway and urban) and indicate that the STGMT outperforms state-of-the-art models.

As an important guarantee for the stable operation of intelligent substation, the research on fault diagnosis technology is particularly important. In this paper, the acoustic characteristic diagnosis of substation equipment (take transformers for example) is researched and the application of \"Voice Recognition + artificial neural network (ANN)\"technology in substation fault diagnosis is analyzed. At the same time, the continuous online monitoring of the intelligent substation equipment will produce a large amount of monitoring data, which needs to be analyzed timely and effectively to understand the operating status of the equipment accurately. Because of this, this paper adopts distributed computing by establishing a real-time distributed computing platform, using open source technology to store the online monitoring of sound data into the computing platform for data processing to achieve the purpose of automatic fault detection and analysis. The results show that distributed computing can realize the intelligent analysis, storage, and visualization of equipment data in the substation, which provides data support for fault diagnosis. Besides, the fitting accuracy rates of ANN model are 95.123% for training process and the fitting accuracy rates of ANN model are 99.353% for training process and the overall fitting accuracy rates of ANN model are 95.478% and the error between the predicted value and the actual value of the 5 sound signals is within 5% in the fault diagnosis process. Consequently, the ANN model can accurately identify each fault sound of substation and achieve the purpose of fault diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Traffic prediction plays a significant part in creating intelligent cities such as traffic management, urban computing, and public safety. Nevertheless, the complex spatio-temporal linkages and dynamically shifting patterns make it somewhat challenging. Existing mainstream traffic prediction approaches heavily rely on graph convolutional networks and sequence prediction methods to extract complicated spatio-temporal patterns statically. However, they neglect to account for dynamic underlying correlations and thus fail to produce satisfactory prediction results. Therefore, we propose a novel Self-Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SASTGCN) for traffic prediction. A self-adaptive calibrator, a spatio-temporal feature extractor, and a predictor comprise the bulk of the framework. To extract the distribution bias of the input in the self-adaptive calibrator, we employ a self-supervisor made of an encoder–decoder structure. The concatenation of the bias and the original characteristics are provided as input to the spatio-temporal feature extractor, which leverages a transformer and graph convolution structures to learn the spatio-temporal pattern, and then applies a predictor to produce the final prediction. Extensive trials on two public traffic prediction datasets (METR-LA and PEMS-BAY) demonstrate that SASTGCN surpasses the most recent techniques in several metrics.",

The Apriori algorithm is extended with spatio-temporal constraints to extract frequent transit mobility patterns of individual passengers based on a reconstructed personal trip dataset. This individual-level pattern information is used to construct personalized feature vectors. For regular and frequent public transit passengers, we identify similar transit mobility groups using spatio-temporal constraints to construct a group feature vector. We develop a generative adversarial network to embed public transit mobility of passengers. The proposed model’s generator consists of an auto-encoder, which extracts a low-dimensional and compact representation of passenger behavior, and a pre-trained sub-generator containing generalization features of public transit passengers. Shenzhen City is taken as the study area in this paper, and experiments were carried out based on smart card data, road network data, and bus GPS data. Clustering analysis of embedding vector representation and estimation of the top K transit destinations were conducted, verifying that the proposed method can profile passenger transit mobility in a comprehensive and compact manner.",

    "abstract": "Citizen complaint classification plays an important role in the construction of the smart city. For text data, the most expressive semantic information is reflected in the keyword of the text. With the proposed Transformer structure and further expansion of the model structure, natural language processing has embarked on a path of fine-tuning the pre-trained model based on the multi-headed attention mechanism. Although the above method works well, it further deepens the black box model of the network. To verify whether the multi-headed attention mechanism adds enough attention to the keyword information, this paper proposes a joint attention enhancement network that places the attention mechanism outside the main network model. This paper uses the idea of lexical frequency statistics to obtain keyword information through the macroscopic use of corpus contents and improves the attention through knowledge incorporation based on soft attention. In this paper, a comparison experiment is performed by the current hot open-source network models on Hugging Face. Experiments show that the proposed model improves about 10%-20% in accuracy compared with the different original models, while the network training time only increases about 5%. The joint enhancement network can identify the key region of input data more accurately and converge quickly.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing (RS) has developed significantly with the progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) which is allowed the cheap and fast acquisition of data in millions and billions of interrelated devices utilized throughout the whole world. RS scene classifier that purposes for classifying scene types for RS images has wide applications in several domains like urban planning, national defence security, environmental monitoring, and natural hazard detection. State-of-the-art deep learning (DL) successes are performed in a novel wave of RS scene classification applications, but it is the absence of explainability and trustworthiness. An intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a vital role to ensure security in the RS-based IoT environment. In this aspect, this study presents an ebola optimization algorithm with deep learning-based scene classification and intrusion detection (EOADL-SCID) technique on IoT-enabled remote sensing images. The aim of the EOADL-SCID system lies in the effectual scene classification of remote sensing images and intrusion detection. It involves a two-stage procedure. In the initial stage, the EOADL-SCID algorithm involves a modified DarkNet-53 feature extractor, EOA-based hyperparameter tuning, and graph convolution network (GCN) based classification. Next, in the second stage, the intrusion detection process takes place via two subprocesses namely variational autoencoder (VAE) based intrusion detection and skill optimization algorithm (SOA) based parameter tuning. The simulation outcomes of the EOADL-SCID approach are tested utilizing two benchmark databases and the experimental outcomes highlighted the improved performance of the EOADL-SCID algorithm on scene classification and intrusion classification processes.",

However, the presence of obstacles, potholes, and complex road environments, such as poor illumination and occlusion, can cause blurred road images that may impact the accuracy of maneuver prediction in visual perception systems. To address these challenges, a novel ensemble model, named ABHO-based deep CNN-BiLSTM has been proposed for traffic sign detection. This model combines a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with the alarming-based hunting optimization (ABHO) algorithm to improve maneuver prediction accuracy. Additionally, a modified hough-enabled lane generative adversarial network (ABHO based HoughGAN) has been proposed, which is designed to be robust to blurred images. The ABHO algorithm, inspired by the defending and social characteristics of starling birds and Canis latrans, allows the model to efficiently search for the optimal solution from the available solutions in the search space. The proposed ensemble model has shown significantly improved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in maneuver prediction compared to previously utilized methods, with minimal error during lane detection. Overall, the proposed ensemble model addresses the challenges faced by autonomous driving vehicles in complex and obstructed road environments, offering a promising solution for enhancing safety and reliability in smart cities.",

UAVs can be used for a wide range of applications, including emergency response, civil protection, search and rescue, and surveillance, thanks to their high mobility and reasonable price. Automatic recognition of human activity in aerial videos captured by drones is critical for various tasks for these applications.

Although deep learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of challenging vision tasks, they require either a large number of labelled aerial videos for training or a dataset with balanced classes, both of which can be difficult to obtain. To address these challenges, a hybrid data augmentation method is proposed which combines data transformation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based feature augmentation method. In particular, we apply the basic transformation methods to increase the amount of video in the database. A Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model is used to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of actions, then a GAN-based technique is applied to generate synthetic CNN-LSTM features conditioned on action classes which provide a high discriminative spatio-temporal features.

    "abstract": "Accurate building detection is a critical task in urban development and digital city mapping. However, current building detection models for high-resolution remote sensing images are still facing challenges due to complex object characteristics and similarities in appearance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for building detection based on in-depth feature extraction and classification of adaptive superpixel shredding. The proposed approach consists of four main steps: image segmentation into homogeneous superpixels using a modified Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC), in-depth feature extraction using an variational auto-encoder (VAE) scale on the superpixels for training and testing data collection, identification of four classes (buildings, roads, trees, and shadows) using extracted feature data as input to an Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and extraction of building shapes through regional growth and morphological operations. The proposed approach offers more stability in identifying buildings with unclear boundaries, eliminating the requirement for extensive prior segmentation. It has been tested on two datasets of high-resolution aerial images from the New Zealand region, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to previous works with an average F1 score of 98.83%. The proposed approach shows potential for fast and accurate urban monitoring and city planning, particularly in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, traffic forecasting has gradually become a core component of smart cities. Due to the complex spatial-temporal correlation of traffic data, traffic flow prediction is highly challenging. Existing studies are mainly focused on graphical modeling of fixed road structures. However, this fixed graphical structure cannot accurately capture the relationship between different roads, affecting the accuracy of long-term traffic flow prediction. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a modeling framework STN-GCN for spatial-temporal normalized graphical convolutional neural networks. In terms of temporal dependence, spatial-temporal normalization was used to divide the data into high-frequency and low-frequency parts, allowing the model to extract more distinct features. In addition, fine data input to the temporal convolutional network (TCN) was used in this module to conduct more detailed temporal feature extraction so as to ensure the accuracy of long-term sequence extraction. In addition, the transformer module was added to the model, which captured the real-time state of traffic flow by extracting spatial dependencies and dynamically establishing spatial correlations through a self-attention mechanism. During the training process, a curriculum learning (CL) method was adopted, which provided optimized target sequences. Learning from easier targets can help avoid getting trapped in local minima and yields better generalization performance to more accurately approximate global minima. As shown by experimental results the model performed well on two real-world public transportation datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction of vehicles is of great importance to various smart city applications ranging from transportation scheduling, vehicle navigation, to location-based advertisements. Existing methods all focus on modeling spatiotemporal relations with explicit contextual semantics from labeled trajectory data, and rarely consider the effective use of large amounts of available unlabeled trajectory data with the assistance of contrastive learning and pre-training techniques. To this end, we develop a novel Pretrained-based Contrastive Learning Network (PreCLN) for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we propose a dual-view trajectory contrastive learning framework to achieve self-supervised pre-training. A Transformer-based trajectory encoder is designed to effectively capture the long-term spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectories to embed input trajectories into fixed-length representation vectors. Moreover, three auxiliary pre-training tasks, i.e., trajectory imputation, trajectory destination prediction, and trajectory-user linking, are used to assist the training of PreCLN with the dual-view trajectory contrastive learning framework. After pre-training, the result trajectory encoder is used to generate trajectory representations for future trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world large-scale trajectory datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of PreCLN against state-of-the-art trajectory prediction baselines in terms of all evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Haze significantly impacts various fields, such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and security monitoring. Deep learning has been proven effective in removing haze from images. However, obtaining pixel-aligned hazy and clear paired images in the real world can be challenging. Therefore, synthesized hazed images are often used for training deep networks. These images are typically generated based on parameters such as depth information and atmospheric scattering coefficient. However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images. This method has broadened the applications of deep learning in haze removal, particularly highlighting its potential in the fields of autonomous driving and smart cities.",

For relieving the large computation consumption and low accuracy problem in point cloud classification, a large scale point cloud classification framework based on light bottle transformer (light-BotNet) is proposed. Firstly, the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) feature values of large scale point cloud were extracted for constructing point cloud feature images, which employed the prior knowledge to normalize the point cloud features.

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus that triggered the COVID-19 outburst is still active around the globe. By now, COVID-19 has affected practically every facet of progress, most importantly, it has shaken the healthcare system like never before. At its peak, it forced Governments throughout the world into lockdowns to limit the reach of the epidemic. Based on early advisories of the World Health Organization (WHO), the only method of safeguarding oneself from being infected was to wear a face mask. Even today, with fewer cases being reported, masking oneself remains the single most effective and cheap means of prevention. As urban areas continue to grow, effective city management is essential for mitigating the increase of the deadly COVID-19 disease. The success of smart cities depends on significant upgrades to public transportation, highways, companies, homes, and municipal streets. There is room for improvement in the public bus transportation system now in place, and one of those improvements would be to use artificial intelligence. To determine if the person is wearing a face mask, you need an autonomous mask detection and alert system. Therefore, this study introduced a deep learning-based design that combines the attention-based generative adversarial network (ABGAN) with the multi-objective interactive honeybee mating optimization (MOIHBMO) approach to create an automated face mask recognition system. A set of 1386 images has been used to create a real-time dataset. This database contains 690 pictures without face masks and 686 images with them. The suggested algorithm ABGAN-MOIHBMO is compared to other traditional methods for detection of face masks, such as DL, AI, and DNN. The performance indicators used are error rate, inference speed, precision, recall, accuracy, and over fitting assessments. The results demonstrate that the proposed ABGAN-MOIHBMO outperforms the existing methodologies. It provides 96% of precision, 86% of recall, 93% for the f1 score, which are higher/better than the other, traditional methods. The error rate in ABGAN-MOIHBMO is a low 1.1%, which is lower other approaches. To predict and underline the significance of face mask use, the face mask detection technique may be employed in the future at Saudi airports, shopping centers, and other congested locations. On a larger platform, our research will be an effective instrument in helping many nations throughout the globe combat the rapid spread of this contagious illness.",

Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items. However, the interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential recommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type behavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users and items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance to accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference. In this work, we tackle the dynamic user-item relation learning with the awareness of multi-behavior interactive patterns.

    "abstract": "Reconstruction-based and prediction-based approaches are widely used for video anomaly detection (VAD) in smart city surveillance applications. However, neither of these approaches can effectively utilize the rich contextual information that exists in videos, which makes it difficult to accurately perceive anomalous activities. In this paper, we exploit the idea of a training model based on the “Cloze Test” strategy in natural language processing (NLP) and introduce a novel unsupervised learning framework to encode both motion and appearance information at an object level. Specifically, to store the normal modes of video activity reconstructions, we first design an optical stream memory network with skip connections. Secondly, we build a space–time cube (STC) for use as the basic processing unit of the model and erase a patch in the STC to form the frame to be reconstructed. This enables a so-called ”incomplete event (IE)” to be completed. On this basis, a conditional autoencoder is utilized to capture the high correspondence between optical flow and STC. The model predicts erased patches in IEs based on the context of the front and back frames. Finally, we employ a generating adversarial network (GAN)-based training method to improve the performance of VAD. By distinguishing the predicted erased optical flow and erased video frame, the anomaly detection results are shown to be more reliable with our proposed method which can help reconstruct the original video in IE. Comparative experiments conducted on the benchmark UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets demonstrate AUROC scores reaching 97.7%, 89.7%, and 75.8%, respectively.",

    "contribution": "In this paper, we exploit the idea of a training model based on the “Cloze Test” strategy in natural language processing (NLP) and introduce a novel unsupervised learning framework to encode both motion and appearance information at an object level. Specifically, to store the normal modes of video activity reconstructions, we first design an optical stream memory network with skip connections. Secondly, we build a space–time cube (STC) for use as the basic processing unit of the model and erase a patch in the STC to form the frame to be reconstructed. This enables a so-called ”incomplete event (IE)” to be completed. On this basis, a conditional autoencoder is utilized to capture the high correspondence between optical flow and STC. The model predicts erased patches in IEs based on the context of the front and back frames. Finally, we employ a generating adversarial network (GAN)-based training method to improve the performance of VAD. By distinguishing the predicted erased optical flow and erased video frame, the anomaly detection results are shown to be more reliable with our proposed method which can help reconstruct the original video in IE. Comparative experiments conducted on the benchmark UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets demonstrate AUROC scores reaching 97.7%, 89.7%, and 75.8%, respectively.",
    "introduction": "Reconstruction-based and prediction-based approaches are widely used for video anomaly detection (VAD) in smart city surveillance applications. However, neither of these approaches can effectively utilize the rich contextual information that exists in videos, which makes it difficult to accurately perceive anomalous activities.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) can classify each network’s flow behavior as benign or malicious by detecting heterogeneous features, including both categorical and numerical features. However, the present ML-based NIDSs are deemed insufficient in terms of their ability to generalize, particularly in changing network environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home. Although IoT devices add so much to home comforts, they also introduce potential risks and vulnerabilities. Recently, many NIDS studies on other IoT scenarios, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and smart cities, focus on utilizing the telemetry data of IoT devices for IoT intrusion detection. Because when IoT devices are under attack, their abnormal telemetry data values can reflect the anomaly state of those devices. Those telemetry data-based IoT NIDS methods detect intrusion events from a different view, focusing on the attack impact, from the traditional network traffic-based NIDS, which focuses on analyzing attack behavior. The telemetry data-based NIDS is more suitable for IoT devices without built-in security mechanisms. Considering the smart home IoT scenario, which has a smaller scope and a limited number of IoT devices compared to other IoT scenarios, both NIDS views can work independently. This motivated us to propose a novel ML-based NIDS to combine the network traffic-based and telemetry data-based NIDS together. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based IoT NIDS method to learn the behaviors and effects of attacks from different types of data that are generated in the heterogeneous IoT environment. The proposed method utilizes a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual embeddings for input network features. Based on the contextual embeddings, our method can solve the feature set challenge, including both continuous and categorical features. Our method is the first to utilize both network traffic data and IoT sensors’ telemetry data at the same time for intrusion detection. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our method on a realistic network traffic intrusion detection dataset named ToN_IoT, with an accuracy of 97.95% for binary classification and 95.78% for multiple classifications on pure network data. With the extra IoT information, the performance of our method has been improved to 98.39% and 97.06%, respectively.

    "abstract": "The construction of Smart Cities is inseparable from the healthy operation of markets. Reasonable data analysis can provide a crucial foundation for the development of market behavior by considering the enormous amount of data generated by a market economy. To this end, we propose enhanced cluster generative adversarial networks (eClusterGAN) to achieve latent space clustering. However, data storage security is crucial. Moreover, we suggest a GAN-based network intrusion detection system (GAN–NIDS) that uses adversarial learning to assist the generator in learning the spatial distribution of normal network flows. The simulation results showed that the proposed eClusterGAN and GAN–NIDS outperformed the benchmarks in terms of clustering accuracy, running time, precision, recall, and F1, which can support researchers in studying economic data trends. The construction of Smart Cities can effectively ensure healthy market development by discovering and disseminating the potential value of market economic data.",

    "abstract": "Anomalous event recognition requires an instant response to reduce the loss of human life and property; however, existing automated systems show limited performance due to considerations related to the temporal domain of the videos and ignore the significant role of spatial information. Furthermore, although current surveillance systems can detect anomalous events, they require human intervention to recognise their nature and to select appropriate countermeasures, as there are no fully automatic surveillance techniques that can simultaneously detect and interpret anomalous events. Therefore, we present a framework called Vision Transformer Anomaly Recognition (ViT-ARN) that can detect and interpret anomalies in smart city surveillance videos. The framework consists of two stages: the first involves online anomaly detection, for which a customised, lightweight, one-class deep neural network is developed to detect anomalies in a surveillance environment, while in the second stage, the detected anomaly is further classified into the corresponding class. The size of our anomaly detection model is compressed using a filter pruning strategy based on a geometric median, with the aim of easy adaptability for resource-constrained devices. Anomaly classification is based on vision transformer features and is followed by a bottleneck attention mechanism to enhance the representation. The refined features are passed to a multi-reservoir echo state network for a detailed analysis of real-world anomalies such as vandalism and road accidents. A total of 858 and 1600 videos from two datasets are used to train the proposed model, and extensive experiments on the LAD-2000 and UCF-Crime datasets comprising 290 and 400 testing videos reveal that our framework can recognise anomalies more effectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches with increases in accuracy of 10.14% and 3% on the LAD-2000 and UCF-Crime datasets, respectively.",

Lastly, real-time anomaly detection for high-dimensional data requires efficient algorithms that are capable of handling different types of data (i.e. continuous and discrete). We propose a correlation structure-based collective anomaly detection (CSCAD) model for high-dimensional anomaly detection problem in large systems, which is also generalizable to semi-supervised or supervised settings. Our framework utilize graph convolutional network combining a variational autoencoder to jointly exploit the feature space correlation and reconstruction deficiency of samples to perform anomaly detection. We propose an extended mutual information (EMI) metric to mine the internal correlation structure among different data features, which enhances the data reconstruction capability of CSCAD. The reconstruction loss and latent standard deviation vector of a sample obtained from reconstruction network can be perceived as two natural anomalous degree measures. An anomaly discriminating network can then be trained using low anomalous degree samples as positive samples, and high anomalous degree samples as negative samples. Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms all the competing baselines.",

    "abstract": "The most crucial component of any smart city traffic management system is traffic flow prediction. It can assist a driver in selecting the most efficient route to their destination. The digitalization of closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems has resulted in more effective and capable surveillance imaging systems for security applications. The number of automobiles on the world’s highways has steadily increased in recent decades. However, road capacity has not developed at the same rate, resulting in significantly increasing congestion. The model learning mechanism cannot be guided or improved by prior domain knowledge of real-world problems. In reality, symmetrical features are common in many real-world research objects. To mitigate this severe situation, the researchers chose adaptive traffic management to make intelligent and efficient use of the current infrastructure. Data grow exponentially and become a complex item that must be managed. Unstructured data are a subset of big data that are difficult to process and have volatile properties. CCTV cameras are used in traffic management to monitor a specific point on the roadway. CCTV generates unstructured data in the form of images and videos. Because of the data’s intricacy, these data are challenging to process. This study proposes using big data analytics to transform real-time unstructured data from CCTV into information that can be shown on a web dashboard. As a Hadoop-based architectural stack that can serve as the ICT backbone for managing unstructured data efficiently, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores several sorts of data using the Hadoop file storage system, a high-performance integrated virtual environment (HIVE) tables, and non-relational storage. Traditional computer vision algorithms are incapable of processing such massive amounts of visual data collected in real-time. However, the inferiority of traffic data and the quality of unit information are always symmetrical phenomena. As a result, there is a need for big data analytics with machine learning, which entails processing and analyzing vast amounts of visual data, such as photographs or videos, to uncover semantic patterns that may be interpreted. As a result, smart cities require a more accurate traffic flow prediction system. In comparison to other recent methods applied to the dataset, the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy of 98.21%. In this study, we look at the construction of a secure CCTV strategy that predicts traffic from CCTV surveillance using real-time traffic prediction analysis with generative adversarial networks (GAN) and HDFS.",

    "abstract": "Urban flow monitoring and forecasting systems play important roles in smart city management. However, due to the long-lasting and enormous deployment cost of ubiquitous traffic monitoring devices (e.g., loop detectors, traffic video detection), it is very difficult to predict flow in high-resolution (HR) with limited monitoring devices. The existing spatiotemporal network based methods usually predict the urban flow in the same spatial scale without considering the spatial correlations between coarse-grained and fine-grained urban flows. To tackle these issues, we propose a HR spatiotemporal transformer network (HRSTT) to predict fine-grained urban flow. Specifically, residual convolution units are employed to constructs the high-level features of three-view temporal (e.g., closeness, period, and trend) flow data. Then, a transformer block is designed to jointly learn the spatiotemporal dynamic features of each temporal flow with self-attention mechanism. For the external factors (e.g., holidays, weather conditions) are extracted by embedding dense networks, which are fused with high level coarse-grained flow feature maps with gated-fusion scheme. Finally, the coarse-grained fusion feature maps are transferred to the distributional upsampling module, generating the fined-grained flow map of target predicted time. Furthermore, the proposed model is evaluated with several baselines on real-world TaxiBJ datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance of our approach on the fine-grained urban flow forecasting problem.",

    "abstract": "A community integrated energy system (CIES) is an important carrier of the energy internet and smart city in geographical and functional terms. Its emergence provides a new solution to the problems of energy utilization and environmental pollution. To coordinate the integrated demand response and uncertainty of renewable energy generation (RGs), a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is constructed. A comprehensive norm consisting of the 1-norm and ∞-norm is used as the uncertainty probability distribution information set, thereby avoiding complex probability density information. To address multiple uncertainties of RGs, a generative adversarial network based on the Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty is proposed to generate RG scenarios, which has wide applicability. To further tap the potential of the demand response, we take into account the ambiguity of human thermal comfort and the thermal inertia of buildings. Thus, an integrated demand response mechanism is developed that effectively promotes the consumption of renewable energy. The proposed method is simulated in an actual CIES in North China. In comparison with traditional stochastic programming and robust optimization, it is verified that the proposed DRO model properly balances the relationship between economical operation and robustness while exhibiting stronger adaptability. Furthermore, our approach outperforms other commonly used DRO methods with better operational economy, lower renewable power curtailment rate, and higher computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Traffic problems continue to deteriorate because of increasing population in urban areas that rely on many modes of transportation, the transportation infrastructure has achieved considerable strides in the last several decades. This has led to an increase in congestion control difficulties, which directly affect citizens through air pollution, fuel consumption, traffic law breaches, noise pollution, accidents, and loss of time. Traffic prediction is an essential aspect of an intelligent transportation system in smart cities because it helps reduce overall traffic congestion. This article aims to design and enforce a traffic prediction scheme that is efficient and accurate in forecasting traffic flow. Available traffic flow prediction methods are still unsuitable for real-world applications. This fact motivated us to work on a traffic flow forecasting issue using Vision Transformers (VTs). In this work, VTs were used in conjunction with Convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict traffic congestion in urban spaces on a city-wide scale. In our proposed architecture, a traffic image is fed to a CNN, which generates feature maps. These feature maps are then fed to the VT, which employs the dual techniques of tokenization and projection. Tokenization is used to convert features into tokens containing Vision information, which are then sent to projection, where they are transformed into feature maps and ultimately delivered to LSTM. The experimental results demonstrate that the vision transformer prediction method based on Spatio-temporal characteristics is an excellent way of predicting traffic flow, particularly during anomalous traffic situations. The proposed technology surpasses traditional methods in terms of precision, accuracy and recall and aids in energy conservation. Through rerouting, the proposed work will benefit travellers and reduce fuel use.",

    "abstract": "Acquiring road information is important for smart cities and sustainable urban development. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the extraction of urban road information from remote sensing images using deep learning (DL) algorithms. However, due to the complex shape, narrowness, and high span of roads in the images, the results are often unsatisfactory. This article proposes a Seg-Road model to improve road connectivity. The Seg-Road uses a transformer structure to extract the long-range dependency and global contextual information to improve the fragmentation of road segmentation and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure to extract local contextual information to improve the segmentation of road details. Furthermore, a novel pixel connectivity structure (PCS) is proposed to improve the connectivity of road segmentation and the robustness of prediction results. To verify the effectiveness of Seg-Road for road segmentation, the DeepGlobe and Massachusetts datasets were used for training and testing. The experimental results show that Seg-Road achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an intersection over union (IoU) of 67.20%, mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 82.06%, F1 of 91.43%, precision of 90.05%, and recall of 92.85% in the DeepGlobe dataset, and achieves an IoU of 68.38%, MIoU of 83.89%, F1 of 90.01%, precision of 87.34%, and recall of 92.86% in the Massachusetts dataset, which is better than the values for CoANet. Further, it has higher application value for achieving sustainable urban development.",

The study aims to improve the efficiency of power inspection in power enterprises and provide intelligent technology for power inspection. After the theoretical analysis of IoT and RFID technology under the background of smart city, the study discusses the information acquisition principle of RFID technology. Second, based on IoT and smart grid, the study takes the power equipment of power company A as an example, and puts forward the power inspection scheme, including the information required for inspection and the inspection of primary and secondary equipment. The specific contents are as follows: health assessment is carried out according to the real-time alarm of power equipment, and the control command is sent to the downstream control equipment to confirm the alarm information. Meantime, based on the alarm information of power equipment and related equipment, the expert analysis system is used for reasoning and analysis, and the RFID tag is used to supervise the inspectors to arrive at the site and inspect the situation according to the predetermined route. The temperature of the cable of power company A is measured under normal and hidden dangers, and the body insulation test is conducted on No. 1 main transformer. The results show that under normal operation, the cable temperature at each point is slightly different, which is basically about 40 °C. The temperature before the fourth point of the cable rises obviously, indicating that the fourth point has faulty. Over time, the more chemical molecules are detected in phase A. When phase B and phase C are tested on the same day, the difference of chemical molecular content is relatively small. It indicates that the chemical molecular content detected by chromatographic test of bulk insulating oil is normal. To sum up, smart power, as the objective need of urban intelligent development, is an important foundation of smart city. The power inspection scheme based on IoT and RFID technology proposed has high detection efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised depth estimation has drawn much attention in recent years as it does not require labeled data but image sequences. Moreover, it can be conveniently used in various applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, realistic navigation, and smart cities. However, extracting global contextual information from images and predicting a geometrically natural depth map remain challenging. In this paper, we present DLNet for pixel-wise depth estimation, which simultaneously extracts global and local features with the aid of our depth Linformer block. This block consists of the Linformer and innovative soft split multi-layer perceptron blocks. Moreover, a three-dimensional geometry smoothness loss is proposed to predict a geometrically natural depth map by imposing the second-order smoothness constraint on the predicted three-dimensional point clouds, thereby realizing improved performance as a byproduct. Finally, we explore the multi-scale prediction strategy and propose the maximum margin dual-scale prediction strategy for further performance improvement. In experiments on the KITTI and Make3D benchmarks, the proposed DLNet achieves performance competitive to those of the state-of-the-art methods, reducing time and space complexities by more than 62% and 56% at a resolution of 416 × 128 , respectively. Extensive testing on various real-world situations further demonstrates the strong practicality and generalization capability of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Next location prediction is helpful for service recommendation, public safety, intelligent transportation, and other location-based applications. Existing location prediction methods usually use sparse check-in trajectories and require massive historical data to capture complex spatial-temporal correlations. High spatial-temporal resolution trajectories have rich information. However, obtaining personal trajectories with long time series and high spatiotemporal resolution usually proves challenging. Herein, this paper proposes a two-stage Context-Aware Spatial-Temporal Location Embedding (CASTLE) model, a multi-modal pre-training model for sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. The method is built in two steps. First, large-scale location datasets, which are sparse but easier to be acquired (i.e., check-in and anomalous navigation data), are used for pre-training location embedding to capture the multi-functional properties under different contexts. After that, the learned contextual embedding is used for downstream location prediction in small-scale but higher spatiotemporal resolution trajectory datasets. Specifically, the CASTLE model combines Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers to generate contextual embedding vectors rather than a fixed vector for each location. Furthermore, we introduce a location and time-aware encoder to reflect the spatial distances between locations and visit times. Experiments are conducted on two real trajectory datasets. The results show that the CASTLE model can pre-train beneficial location embedding and outperforms the model without pre-training by 4.6-7.1%. The proposed method is expected to improve the next location prediction accuracy without massive historical data, which will greatly drive the use of trajectory data.",

    "abstract": "Smart cities represent the zenith of technological integration, aiming to uplift living experiences and operational efficiency within urban regions. With music being intrinsically intertwined with societal living, embedding it seamlessly into digitized cities remains a challenge. The rapid evolution of music generation algorithms based on Transformer models has opened a promising avenue in this context. However, applying music generation to smart cities presents two problems: 1) Previous work only considers forward information by adopting an upper-triangular mask. Although this can avoid information leakage, global information of music pieces may not be well captured, harming the overall structure and quality of generated samples and making it challenging to generate complete melodies in longer segments. 2) Due to the randomness of sampling, the generated music sometimes has discordant notes, affecting the practical usage experience. To alleviate these problems, we introduce the masked global information network on the transformer language model to incorporate global information constraints in a joint training manner. With this succinct approach, complete melodies with reasonable repetition and musical structure can be generated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the global information network can be extended as a post-processing module by reusing the hidden layer states from prior networks to further improve the quality of samples in a non-autoregressive way. Both objective and subjective studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, by integrating this pluggable global information network, an enhancement in generative outcomes is achieved without incurring additional computational complexity or energy expenditure during inference, presenting a green optimization strategy.",

    "abstract": "Indoor location-based services (LBS) hold significant potential for social and commercial value in smart city development. However, fingerprint-based indoor localization technologies face challenges due to the dynamic indoor environment. Updating the fingerprint database through dense site surveys is costly. Therefore, a method utilizing sparse samples (10%) is attractive. This work proposes the fingerprint database adaptation paradigm (FDAP), an adaptive update framework designed for sparse samples. The FDAP creates a swin transformer-based reconstruction model (STRM), effectively addressing the issue of inaccurate map reconstruction from sparse samples. Using the STRM significantly reduces the expenses associated with updating the fingerprint database. Additionally, FDAP evaluates the quality of the samples with a signal quality evaluation algorithm (SQEA), assessing the features of dispersion degree, signal strength, and fingerprint correlation from sparse samples. Lastly, FDAP provides a signal correction algorithm (SCA) based on partial least squares regression, which minimizes potential errors for unreliable reconstruction signals. Experiments conducted on a public dataset demonstrate that FDAP effectively accommodates radio map variations over time. It reduces the reconstruction error by 22.2 % compared to the current state-of-the-art method. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Cen-Shaoqi/FDAP.",

    "introduction": "Indoor location-based services (LBS) hold significant potential for social and commercial value in smart city development. However, fingerprint-based indoor localization technologies face challenges due to the dynamic indoor environment. Updating the fingerprint database through dense site surveys is costly. Therefore, a method utilizing sparse samples (10%) is attractive.",

While a plethora of intelligent strategies have been developed, the Sim2Real challenge often impedes their full realization. In response, this paper introduces the Parallel Learning-based Adaptive Network for Traffic Signal Control (PLANT) as a foundation model for NTSC. We employ the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate a wide range of artificial scenarios for robust PLANT training. Further, the Transformer-based Cooperation Mechanism (TCM) is integrated as the primary learner within PLANT, facilitating effective capture of traffic dynamics and knowledge accumulation. This knowledge is readily transferable to real-world applications through meticulous fine-tuning, equipping PLANT to adapt and evolve in alignment with shifting transportation paradigms. Our empirical study on the Hangzhou road network demonstrates PLANT's superiority over both traditional and emerging DRL-based approaches, emphasizing its viability as a potential foundation model for NTSC.",

    "abstract": "In the era of smart cities, the role of surveillance systems in ensuring community safety and environmental sustainability has become increasingly significant. Traditional surveillance methods, reliant on human monitoring, often exhibit deficiencies in terms of speed, accuracy, and scalability. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no related dataset on this research field. This paper introduces a novel approach to address these challenges, leveraging the power of computer vision technology to enhance surveillance capabilities. To bridge the gap between algorithms research and application, in this paper, we propose the task and dataset, and highlight the necessity of camera grading. ONEWO comprises 18,307 images from 2,863 cameras, which covers 20 main objects of interest for city management, providing annotation of bounding boxes and segmentation masks of 121,342 instances. Experiments demonstrate that our best baseline model achieves mAP50 of 77.5 for the entire test set. This work aims at contributing to the development of more efficient, accurate, and scalable surveillance systems, thereby promoting community safety and environmental sustainability in smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval of scenes from traffic videos is an important task in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for efficient traffic management in AI smart cities. This work proposes natural language-based vehicle retrieval from traffic monitoring videos, emphasizing the significance of temporal information and context. We present contrastive learning as a technique to optimize joint representations of vision and language modalities within a shared latent representation space. The approach involves training contrastive losses to keep similar encodings closer in joint feature representation space by minimizing the distance between positive visual-text pairs and maximizing the distance between negative visual-text pairs. Our study employs state-of-the-art vision models for visual encoding and transformer-based language models for text encoding. We analyze the impact of feature selection from visuals and text on retrieval performance. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed method on the AI City Challenge 2022 dataset for natural language-based vehicle retrieval, achieving performance accuracy of 49.84% Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) on the test dataset, securing second position on the leader board. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of feature selection and contrastive learning for enhancing multimodal retrieval tasks.",

    "abstract": "In order to address the issues brought about by urbanization, population growth, and the demands of sustainable cultural development, the idea of \"smart cities\"was developed. One crucial element of smart cities that helps manage and lessen traffic is smart parking systems. Parking spots are a limited resource, and in crowded areas, finding free spots can be difficult. We provide a real-time free parking slot detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to locate and identify free parking spaces in real-time, thereby resolving the current issue. Our system uses a camera network deployed in the parking area to capture images of the parking slots. These images are processed using deep learning combined with vision transformer and transfer learning algorithms to detect the presence of vehicles in the slots. By analyzing the occupancy status of each slot, our system can identify and locate free parking slots. We evaluate the accomplishment of the model we have offered on a real-world dataset collected from a busy parking area. The findings demonstrate that the offered model outperformed the CNN model with a test accuracy of 95%, while CNN achieved an accuracy of 90%.",

We evaluate the accomplishment of the model we have offered on a real-world dataset collected from a busy parking area. The findings demonstrate that the offered model outperformed the CNN model with a test accuracy of 95%, while CNN achieved an accuracy of 90%.",
    "introduction": "In order to address the issues brought about by urbanization, population growth, and the demands of sustainable cultural development, the idea of \"smart cities\"was developed. One crucial element of smart cities that helps manage and lessen traffic is smart parking systems. Parking spots are a limited resource, and in crowded areas, finding free spots can be difficult. We provide a real-time free parking slot detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to locate and identify free parking spaces in real-time, thereby resolving the current issue.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI) is of paramount importance as the negative health impact of poor air quality on humans has been widely established. The paper proposes an efficient model for AQI prediction based on the transformer algorithm. This model is compared with the widely used RNN-LSTM and regression model and outperforms both. Real-time data on pollutant concentration and meteorological data for the Anand Vihar, Delhi, India monitoring station from November 1, 2017, till August 6, 2022, has been used for analysis. From the data available for 11 pollutants, the AQI is determined as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB’s) formula. The paper aims to predict the AQI along with the levels of PM2.5, CO, and PM10 pollutants. RMSE and MAE for PM2.5 evaluated using transformer are 17.74 and 11.15, respectively, best amongst all the models. Prior and accurate knowledge about Air Quality Index levels is directly relevant for policy-makers and the population at large so that the administrators may implement corrective measures. As the concept of smart cities is rapidly taking shape, the residents of such cities have the right to know about the air quality they are likely to breathe in the near future so that smart responses may be planned well in advance.",

    "abstract": "Sewer pipes are an fundamental infrastructure of modern cities, and their automatic maintenance is an important requirement for the operation of smart cities. The key issue for sewer pipe maintenance is the detection of their defects, which can lead to various levels of maintenance requirements. In this work, we present an optimized deep learning model for defect detection of sewer pipes. The model is optimized in three aspects: the backbone, the neck, and the detection head. The backbone is replaced with Swin Transformer, the neck is enhanced with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and RoI align, and the detection head is optimized by modifying the loss function with GIoU and introducing a new hyperparameter on classification loss. With these optimizations, the model has better feature extraction capability, better small defect detection, and better loss function for model training. Combined with data augmentation techniques, the optimized model achieves significant improvements over the baseline Faster R-CNN model, with mAP increased from 0.606 to 0.743. In addition to mAP improvements, our optimized model is especially effective on finding some sewer defects that are difficult to recognize.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, mobile applications (apps) have gained enormous popularity. Smart services for smart cities increasingly gain attention. The main goal of this proposed research was to present a new artificial intelligence (AI)powered mobile app on Istanbul's traffic congestion forecast using traffic density data. It addresses the research question using time series approaches (long short-term memory (LSTM), Transformer, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) based on past data over the traffic load dataset combined with meteorological conditions. While previous studies were limited to direct Istanbul traffic forecasting, in this study, we focused on district-based traffic forecasting that can be queried with a mobile app. The proposed pipeline was tested on the summarized Istanbul traffic dataset for 6 main distinct districts (Fatih, Buyukcekmece, Atasehir, Kagithane, Tuzla, and Bagcilar). Analysis of the simulation results on predicted models will be discussed according to performance indicators such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean average error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). And then, it was observed that the Transformer model made the most accurate traffic prediction with a minimum MAE score for each district. The developed traffic forecasting prototype is expected to be a starting point for future products for a mobile app suitable for citizens' daily use.",

    "abstract": "Video Surveillance Systems (VSSs) are used in a wide range of applications including public safety and perimeter security. They are deployed in places such as markets, hospitals, schools, banks, shopping malls, offices, and smart cities. VSSs generate a massive amount of surveillance data, and significant research has been published on the use of machine learning algorithms to handle surveillance data. In this paper, we present an extensive overview and a thorough analysis of cutting-edge learning methods used in VSSs. Existing surveys on learning approaches in video surveillance have some drawbacks, such as a lack of in-depth analysis of the learning algorithms, omission of certain methodologies, insufficient critical evaluation, and absence of recent learning algorithms. To fill these gaps, this survey provides a thorough examination of the most recent learning algorithms for anomaly detection. A critical assessment of the algorithms including their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability as well as tailored classifications of anomaly types for different domains are provided. Our study also offers insights into the future development of learning techniques in VSS, positioning itself as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the field. Finally, we share our thoughts on what we learned and how it can help with new developments in the future.",

In this work we focus on creating a model for forecasting the total energy produced by a photovoltaic installation one day in advance. The model is based on the original Transformer architecture. This structure has minor modifications for time series applications. The dataset was created with weather forecasts and the energy and power production of a real photovoltaic installation.

    "abstract": "Structural defects in civil infrastructure, such as highways, roads, bridges, and dams, can severely impact their reliability and safety. Manual inspection of such infrastructure is labor-intensive and costly, creating the demand for automated damage-tracking systems. Data-driven techniques, such as machine learning, and statistical methods have been utilized in a remarkable number of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications. However, real-time and high-accuracy concrete crack detection poses severe challenges for deployment on embedded systems and mobile robotic platforms, due to their computational constraints, low-latency requirements, and the robustness of model predictions in field deployments. This work proposes a robust and low-latency transformer-based deep-crack segmentation model that leverages both Red Green Blue (RGB) and Hyper Spectral (HYP) data for crack detection. The model is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems, enabling structural health monitoring on robotic platforms, and studies the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of the estimated crack maps. The final model is deployed on one of the most popular robotic embedded computation platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 99.54% at an inference time of only 7.41ms using the RGB camera only. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for automating laborious SHM applications such as inspecting critical infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a new distributed privacy-preserving learning paradigm which perfectly meets the requirements of many large service systems such as banking, healthcare, and smart city. Meanwhile, person re-identification, as a technology to associate the images of the same person from different data sources, has been widely used in many smart services such as smart logistics, smart surveillance, and many public searching and rescue missions. Therefore, it is a promising solution to use federated learning for person re-identification to improve the model accuracy while protecting the data privacy. However, the common problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data with heterogeneous clients in federated learning often causes undesirable model accuracy. To address such a problem, in this paper, we propose a novel strategy named federated learning with data augmentation for person re-identification (Fed4ReID). Specifically, to alleviate the impact of Non-IID data, we utilise a pre-trained DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) model for data augmentation at each edge servers. Experiments on public datasets show that our proposed strategy can outperform baseline method in general accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Image Restoration under severe weather circumstances has drawn a lot of interest for many computer vision applications. In order to deliver accurate and high quality surveillance in the context of smart cities, image de-raining is a crucial subject that has been explored extensively in recent years. In order to handle the challenge of removing raindrops, two different strategies are adopted in this research study: The Diffusion model and the Generative adversarial network model. By considering the recent improvements in image deraining methods, this research study proposes a novel technique that makes use of conditional generative adversarial network with adversarial loss, which provides a factor to loss functions and regulates the output for achieving the improved results. In addition, diffusion modelling, a novel patch-based method is used to perform image restoration. Diffusion probabilistic frameworks are used for normalising noise over affected regions. This research study compares and evaluates how well these two techniques perform in eliminating the raindrops from images.

    "contribution": "In order to handle the challenge of removing raindrops, two different strategies are adopted in this research study: The Diffusion model and the Generative adversarial network model. By considering the recent improvements in image deraining methods, this research study proposes a novel technique that makes use of conditional generative adversarial network with adversarial loss, which provides a factor to loss functions and regulates the output for achieving the improved results. In addition, diffusion modelling, a novel patch-based method is used to perform image restoration. Diffusion probabilistic frameworks are used for normalising noise over affected regions. This research study compares and evaluates how well these two techniques perform in eliminating the raindrops from images. This study demonstrates that the diffusion model outperforms the GAN technique in terms of qualitative assessments and visual appearance by conducting a comparative analysis on actual and synthetic data.",
    "introduction": "Image Restoration under severe weather circumstances has drawn a lot of interest for many computer vision applications. In order to deliver accurate and high quality surveillance in the context of smart cities, image de-raining is a crucial subject that has been explored extensively in recent years.",

Although the state-of-the-art Transformer models had shown their capability in behavior recognition, it is unsuitable for the task of short-term behavior understanding (e.g., violent behavior recognition) due to the need for a large amount of data to achieve their best performance. Recently, a simple deep learning architecture, an all multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture called MLP-Mixer, was proposed against Transformer in the task of a few-sample dataset to obtain competitive results. Motivated by spatio-temporal features on neurons, we invent a dual-form dataset for MLP-Mixer-based model training called aggregated spatio-temporal MLP-Mixer (ASM) to handle video understanding tasks. We show that ASM outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer models as well as some of the best-performed convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches on three public datasets, smart-city CCTV violence detection dataset (SCVD), real-life violence situations (RLVS) dataset, and Hockey fight.

    "abstract": "One of the most critical traffic management issues is congestion in modern and big smart cities. The first task is to accurately forecast traffic patterns to reduce congestion and accidents due to rapid economic development and rising number of vehicles. It is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems to accurately anticipate future traffic circumstances (such as traffic flow, speed, and traffic time) so that administrators may take proper preventative actions against congestion and travelers can make better-informed judgments. Better trip planning, more efficient traffic operations, lower carbon emissions, and less congestion are all possible outcomes of this forecast. This paper explores different deep-learning time-series forecasting methods such as LSTM, BiLSTM, Prophet, and Transformer models for making short-term predictions regarding traffic flows to ensure smart mobility. The next step is to analyze traffic patterns to provide convenient transportation mobility.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things, low energy consumption, and intelligent and functionally integrated urban infrastructure construction are crucial elements in the development of smart cities. Distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging infrastructure play a vital role in the planning and construction of smart cities. However, the uncertainty associated with the power output of distributed generation significantly impacts the planning of distribution networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability. Additionally, in terms of algorithm efficiency, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms tested in terms of the number of iterations and speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed planning model in improving the economy and stability of the distribution network. Furthermore, it enhances the computational efficiency of the planning problem associated with distributed power supply and electric vehicle charging stations. The findings of this research hold substantial research significance for the site selection planning of distributed power supply.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of smart city construction, the importance of vehicle re-identification based on video surveillance has become increasingly prominent. The task of vehicle re-identification mainly focuses on recognizing the same vehicle image under different cameras. In this paper, we propose a multi-label fusion framework for vehicle re-identification based on VIT network. We design a method of anti-angle distortion data augmentation to solve the problem that the performance of VIT is limited by the relative position relationship inside the vehicle structure and the angle deviation caused by the different relative positions of camera and vehicle. At the same time, the key position weight information module is inserted into the coding layer to improve the network's attention to key information. Finally, in view of the insufficient use of the location information between patches in the VIT network, we design a location code based on the Minkowski distance metric to add the relative location relationships within the vehicle individuals to the network. The experiment shows that under the same conditions, our vehicle weight recognition system is superior to most of the more advanced work in vehicle-ID and VERI776 datasets compared with the most advanced supervised vehicle weight recognition work.",

    "abstract": "Background. As an important part of smart cities, smart water environmental protection has become an important way to solve water environmental pollution problems. It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

    "abstract": "Due to the high inherent uncertainty of renewable energy, probabilistic day-ahead wind power forecasting is crucial for modeling and controlling the uncertainty of renewable energy smart grids in smart cities. However, the accuracy and reliability of high-resolution day-ahead wind power forecasting are constrained by unreliable local weather prediction and incomplete power generation data. This article proposes a physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) surrogates method to augment the incomplete dataset and quantify its uncertainty to improve wind power forecasting performance. The incomplete dataset, built with numerical weather prediction data, historical wind power generation, and weather factors data, is augmented based on generative adversarial networks. After augmentation, the enriched data is then fed into a multiple AI surrogates model constructed by two extreme learning machine networks to train the forecasting model for wind power. Therefore, the forecasting models’ accuracy and generalization ability are improved by mining the implicit physics information from the incomplete dataset. An incomplete dataset gathered from a wind farm in North China, containing only 15 days of weather and wind power generation data with missing points caused by occasional shutdowns, is utilized to verify the proposed method’s performance. Compared with other probabilistic forecasting methods, the proposed method shows better accuracy and probabilistic performance on the same incomplete dataset, which highlights its potential for more flexible and sensitive maintenance of smart grids in smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary attackers, mainly motivated by financial gain, consistently devise sophisticated penetration techniques to access important information or data. The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the contemporary convergence environment to connect to corporate networks and cloud-based applications only worsens this situation, as it facilitates multiple new attack vectors to emerge effortlessly. As such, existing intrusion detection systems suffer from performance degradation mainly because of insufficient considerations and poorly modeled detection systems. To address this problem, we designed a blended threat detection approach, considering the possible impact and dimensionality of new attack surfaces due to the aforementioned convergence.We collectively refer to the convergence of different technology sectors as the internet of blended environment. The proposed approach encompasses an ensemble of heterogeneous probabilistic autoencoders that leverage the corresponding advantages of a convolutional variational autoencoder and long short-term memory variational autoencoder. An extensive experimental analysis conducted on the TON_IoT dataset demonstrated 96.02% detection accuracy.Furthermore, performance of the proposed approach was compared with various single model (autoencoder)-based network intrusion detection approaches: autoencoder, variational autoencoder, convolutional variational autoencoder, and long short-term memory variational autoencoder. The proposed model outperformed all compared models, demonstrating F1-score improvements of 4.99%, 2.25%, 1.92%, and 3.69%, respectively.",

    "introduction": "Contemporary attackers, mainly motivated by financial gain, consistently devise sophisticated penetration techniques to access important information or data. The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the contemporary convergence environment to connect to corporate networks and cloud-based applications only worsens this situation, as it facilitates multiple new attack vectors to emerge effortlessly. As such, existing intrusion detection systems suffer from performance degradation mainly because of insufficient considerations and poorly modeled detection systems. To address this problem, we designed a blended threat detection approach, considering the possible impact and dimensionality of new attack surfaces due to the aforementioned convergence.We collectively refer to the convergence of different technology sectors as the internet of blended environment. The proposed approach encompasses an ensemble of heterogeneous probabilistic autoencoders that leverage the corresponding advantages of a convolutional variational autoencoder and long short-term memory variational autoencoder. An extensive experimental analysis conducted on the TON_IoT dataset demonstrated 96.02% detection accuracy.Furthermore, performance of the proposed approach was compared with various single model (autoencoder)-based network intrusion detection approaches: autoencoder, variational autoencoder, convolutional variational autoencoder, and long short-term memory variational autoencoder.

To this end, we propose an enhanced super-resolution framework (Urban Flow-aware Super Resolution - Generative Adversarial Network, UrbanSG) to deduce fine-grained UFH for urban resource allocation. Specifically, we employ a conditional-GAN as the backbone, considering external factors as the specified condition. To capture the implicit urban structural correlation, we integrate the flow self-attention mechanism into our model, which focuses on urban grids with active traffic volumes. The evaluations of extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

In this paper, we proposed a method to detect human behavior. The proposed method improves the performance of detection of human behavior and effective in a changing environment.

    "abstract": "Street tree extraction based on the 3-D mobile mapping point cloud plays an important role in building smart cities and creating highly accurate urban street maps. Existing methods are often over- or under-segmented when segmenting overlapping street tree canopies and extracting geometrically complex trees. To address this problem, we propose a method based on improved 3-D morphological analysis for extracting street trees from mobile laser scanner (MLS) point clouds. First, the 3-D semantic point cloud segmentation framework based on deep learning is used for preclassification of the original point cloud to obtain the vegetation point cloud in the scene. Considering the influence of terrain unevenness, the vegetation point cloud is deterraformed and slice point cloud containing tree trunks is obtained through spatial filtering on height. On this basis, a voxel-based region growing method constrained with the changing rate of convex area is used to locate the stree trees. Then we propose a progressive tree crown segmentation method, which first completed the preliminary individual segmentation of the tree crown point cloud based on the voxel-based region growth constrained by the minimum increment rule, and then optimizes the crown edges by 'valley' structure-based clustering. In this article, the proposed method is validated and the accuracy is evaluated using three sets of MLS datasets collected from different scenarios. The experimental results show that the method can effectively identify and localize street trees with different geometries and has a good segmentation effect for street trees with large adhesion between canopies. The accuracy and recall of tree localization are higher than 96.08% and 95.83%, respectively, and the average precision and recall of instance segmentation in three datasets are higher than 93.23% and 95.41%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Smart city power distributions have become promising technologies to meet the demand for energy in developed countries. However, increase in smart grids causes several power quality problems on the smart grid, in particular, current and voltage harmonic distortions, sudden voltage sag and swells, fault current, and isolation deterioration. Smart transformers are potential solutions to improve the power quality on the electric grid. They present energy efficiency, ensure grid reliability and power flow control, voltage regulation, bidirectional power flow, fault current limiting, harmonic blocking, and galvanic isolation. Therefore, this paper offers an optimal selection of a three-stage (AC-DC-DC-AC) smart transformer model and power control strategy for solar PV power plant integrated smart grids. The topology of the rectifier, isolated bidirectional converter, and inverter has soft-switching features. This enables low conduction loss, low electromagnetic interference (EMI), high efficiency, achievable zero-voltage switching for converters, and zero-current switching for electrical auxiliary systems. Operation strategies of the proposed ST, PWM control, voltage, and current control between converters, including a medium-voltage (MV) high-frequency transformer to realize a 10 kVA, 450 Vdc to 220 Vdc, or 220 Vac ST, are presented. Significantly, the ST prototype achieves 96.7% conversion efficiency thanks to its control strategy, even under unstable power generation conditions from the solar PV plant. Experimental results obtained on the 344 Vac 10.4 A load current validates the dv/dt rate 6.8 kV/us.

While urban scenes in UAV image characteristic by large scale variation of objects size and complexity background, which posed challenges to urban scenes segmentation of UAV image. The feature extracting backbone of existing networks cannot extract complex features of UAV image effectively, which limits the performance of urban scenes segmentation. To design segmentation network capable of extracting features of large scale variation urban ground scenes, this study proposed a novel composite transformer network for urban scenes segmentation of UAV image. A composite backbone with aggregation windows multi-head self-attention transformer blocks is proposed to make the extracted features more representatives by adaptive multi-level features fusion, and the full utilisation of contextual information and local information. Position attention modules are inserted in each stage between encoder and decoder to further enhance the spatial attention of extracted feature maps. Finally, a V-shaped decoder which is capable of utilising multi-level features is designed to get accurately dense prediction. The accuracy of urban scenes segmentation could significantly be enhanced in this way and successfully segmented the large scale variation objects from UAV views. Extensive ablation experiments and comparative experiments for the proposed network have been conducted on the public available urban scenes segmentation datasets for UAV imagery. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of designed network structure and the superiority of proposed network over state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) and embedded systems have resulted on a recent increase in use of image processing applications for smart cities’ safety. This enables a cost-adequate scale of automated video surveillance, increasing the data available and releasing human intervention. At the same time, although deep learning is a very intensive task in terms of computing resources, hardware and software improvements have emerged, allowing embedded systems to implement sophisticated machine learning algorithms at the edge. Additionally, new lightweight open-source middleware for constrained resource devices, such as EdgeX Foundry, have appeared to facilitate the collection and processing of data at sensor level, with communication capabilities to exchange data with a cloud enterprise application. The objective of this work is to show and describe the development of two Edge Smart Camera Systems for safety of Smart cities within S4AllCities H2020 project. Hence, the work presents hardware and software modules developed within the project, including a custom hardware platform specifically developed for the deployment of deep learning models based on the I.MX8 Plus from NXP, which considerably reduces processing and inference times; a custom Video Analytics Edge Computing (VAEC) system deployed on a commercial NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform, which provides high level results on person detection processes; and an edge computing framework for the management of those two edge devices, namely Distributed Edge Computing framework, DECIoT. To verify the utility and functionality of the systems, extended experiments were performed. The results highlight their potential to provide enhanced situational awareness and demonstrate the suitability for edge machine vision applications for safety in smart cities.",

    "introduction": "Advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) and embedded systems have resulted on a recent increase in use of image processing applications for smart cities’ safety. This enables a cost-adequate scale of automated video surveillance, increasing the data available and releasing human intervention. At the same time, although deep learning is a very intensive task in terms of computing resources, hardware and software improvements have emerged, allowing embedded systems to implement sophisticated machine learning algorithms at the edge. Additionally, new lightweight open-source middleware for constrained resource devices, such as EdgeX Foundry, have appeared to facilitate the collection and processing of data at sensor level, with communication capabilities to exchange data with a cloud enterprise application.",

    "abstract": "Object detection technology for images generated by optical sensors is of great significance in areas such as national defense security, disaster prediction, and smart city construction. Aiming at the problems of small target size, arbitrary target direction, and complex background in aerial image object detection using optical sensors. By using the images captured by a wild range of optical sensors such as CCD（Charge Coupled Device） and SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar), we propose a more efficient rotating frame object detection algorithm that introduces the MCAB (Multi-branch Convolutional Attention Block) that can process these same types of images taken by the aerial platform using light sensors. First, we construct the module by adding identity, residual branch, and CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) structure to the traditional convolution layer and the activation function to substitute the simple conv module in the network. Secondly, we introduce the Transformer layer at the end of the backbone network to enhance the global perception of the model with low overhead, realize the relationship is modeling between the target and the scene content, and reduce the amount of calculation. We improve the structure of the neck layer by BiFPN (Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network) to speed up network operation, and CBAM is added after C3 to highlight important characteristic information. Our improved YOLOv5 algorithm is tested on the self-made rotating small target aerial data set. Compared with the original algorithm, our model's mean Average Precision (mAP) is improved by 1.8 percentage points, and the accuracy and recall are also enhanced by 0.46 and 0.34 percentage points.",

Given the general lackness of available large datasets, realistic synthetic trajectory datasets become important. This work proposes deep generative models for trajectory data that can learn disentangled models for sophisticated latent patterns. Existing methods rely on predefined heuristics and cannot learn the unknown underlying generative mechanisms. The proposed novel deep generative VAE-like models factorize global and local semantics (habits vs. random routing change). We further develop new inference strategies based on variational inference and constrained optimization to encapsulate spatiotemporal validity. New deep neural network architectures are developed to implement generative and inference models with dynamic latent priors. The proposed methods represent significant quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive experiments. The software is made publicly available 1.",

The best-found results were obtained by Mushtaq and Su, in 2020, using a DenseNet-161 with pretrained weights from ImageNet, and NA-1 and NA-2 as augmentation techniques, which were of 97.98%, 98.52%, and 99.22% for UrbanSound8K, ESC-50, and ESC-10 datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "With the increase of large camera networks around us, it is becoming more difficult to manually identify vehicles. Computer vision enables us to automate this task. More specifically, vehicle re-identification (ReID) aims to identify cars in a camera network with non-overlapping views. Images captured of vehicles can undergo intense variations of appearance due to illumination, pose, or viewpoint. Furthermore, due to small inter-class similarities and large intra-class differences, feature learning is often enhanced with non-visual cues, such as the topology of camera networks and temporal information. These are, however, not always available or can be resource intensive for the model. Following the success of Transformer baselines in ReID, we propose for the first time an outlook-attention-based vehicle ReID framework using the Vision Outlooker as its backbone, which is able to encode finer-level features. We show that, without embedding any additional side information and using only the visual cues, we can achieve an 80.31% mAP and 97.13% R-1 on the VeRi-776 dataset. Besides documenting our research, this paper also aims to provide a comprehensive walkthrough of vehicle ReID. We aim to provide a starting point for individuals and organisations, as it is difficult to navigate through the myriad of complex research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Private car transfer indicates that people drive private cars and travel between urban regions to perform daily activities. Foreseeing private car transfer between urban regions can facilitate a broad scope of applications ranging from route planning, hot region discovery to urban computing. However, three challenges remain. i) Private car transfer between regions is affected by multiple spatio-temporal correlations. ii) Transfer records are highly sparse and imbalanced. iii) Modeling the stay duration of private cars. In this paper, we model private cars’ travel in urban regions as the spatio-temporal graph and formulate private car transfer foreseeing as the time-evolving adjacency matrix prediction of the graph. To specify, we propose MG-GAN (Multiple Graph-based Generative Adversarial Network) to predict private car transfer. For one thing, we design multi-graph dense convolutions with gated recurrent networks as the generative network to capture multiple spatio-temporal correlations. For another, the attentive multi-graph convolutional network is designed as the discriminative network to learn the stay duration correlations of private cars in each region. The iterative adversarial processes between generating and discriminating networks enhance the MG-GAN’s ability to tackle the sparse data problem. Besides, a topic clustering algorithm based on multi-source data fusion is proposed to balance the fused data.

    "contribution": "In this paper, we model private cars’ travel in urban regions as the spatio-temporal graph and formulate private car transfer foreseeing as the time-evolving adjacency matrix prediction of the graph. To specify, we propose MG-GAN (Multiple Graph-based Generative Adversarial Network) to predict private car transfer. For one thing, we design multi-graph dense convolutions with gated recurrent networks as the generative network to capture multiple spatio-temporal correlations. For another, the attentive multi-graph convolutional network is designed as the discriminative network to learn the stay duration correlations of private cars in each region. The iterative adversarial processes between generating and discriminating networks enhance the MG-GAN’s ability to tackle the sparse data problem. Besides, a topic clustering algorithm based on multi-source data fusion is proposed to balance the fused data. Extensive experiments on the real-world private car and taxi trip datasets demonstrate that MG-GAN performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.",
    "introduction": "Private car transfer indicates that people drive private cars and travel between urban regions to perform daily activities. Foreseeing private car transfer between urban regions can facilitate a broad scope of applications ranging from route planning, hot region discovery to urban computing. However, three challenges remain. i) Private car transfer between regions is affected by multiple spatio-temporal correlations. ii) Transfer records are highly sparse and imbalanced. iii) Modeling the stay duration of private cars.",

In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting a novel transformer architecture entitled TrajFormer. Our model first generates continuous point embeddings by jointly considering the input features and the information of spatio-temporal intervals, and then adopts a squeeze function to speed up the representation learning.

    "abstract": "Homes are the building block of cities and societies and therefore smart homes are critical to establishing smart living and are expected to play a key role in enabling smart, sustainable cities and societies. The current literature on smart homes has mainly focused on developing smart functions for homes such as security and ambiance management. Homes are composed of families and are inherently complex phenomena underlined by humans and their relationships with each other, subject to individual, intragroup, intergroup, and intercommunity goals. There is a clear need to understand, define, consolidate existing research, and actualize the overarching roles of smart homes, and the roles of smart homes that will serve the needs of future smart cities and societies. This paper introduces our data-driven parameter discovery methodology and uses it to provide, for the first time, an extensive, fairly comprehensive, analysis of the families and homes landscape seen through the eyes of academics and the public, using over a hundred thousand research papers and nearly a million tweets. We developed a methodology using deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and big data analytics methods (BERT and other machine learning methods) and applied it to automatically discover parameters that capture a comprehensive knowledge and design space of smart families and homes comprising social, political, economic, environmental, and other dimensions. The 66 discovered parameters and the knowledge space comprising 100 s of dimensions are explained by reviewing and referencing over 300 articles from the academic literature and tweets. The knowledge and parameters discovered in this paper can be used to develop a holistic understanding of matters related to families and homes facilitating the development of better, community-specific policies, technologies, solutions, and industries for families and homes, leading to strengthening families and homes, and in turn, empowering sustainable societies across the globe.",

    "abstract": "In generative adversarial networks (GANs), a generator network and discriminator network compete in deep learning tasks to generate real images. To reduce the difference between the generated image and actual image, an edge GAN (eGAN) model using edge detection was proposed. This eGAN model can utilize ambient intelligence, a human-centered technology that includes IoT, smart cities, and autonomous driving. Ambient intelligence is essential for the interconnection between humans and objects. The eGAN model was used to make this connectivity more accurate and reliable. Edge detection is an edge feature that extracts the boundaries of an image and generate images in a fast manner; however, because its threshold is arbitrarily set, the connectivity may be unstable. To solve this problem and improve the performance of the eGAN model, we analyzed various GAN models and edge detection methods and proposed a new edge detection technology using threshold settings. This edge detection method sets the threshold value for images, thereby increasing the accuracy of edge connection and reducing the loss error between the image generated by the eGAN model and actual image. To evaluate the performance of the eGAN model, the error between the generated image and actual image was compared by applying the GAN and eGAN models to the same image dataset. Consequently, it was found that the performance of the eGAN model improved by 21% in comparison to the existing GAN model.",

    "abstract": "Urban informal settlements (UIS) are high-density population areas with low urban infrastructure standards. UIS classification, which automates identifying UIS, is of great significance for various urban computing tasks. Fast and accurate extraction of UIS has the following difficulties. First, from a high-resolution perspective, the buildings in informal settlement areas are low-floor and dense, with complex spatial relationships. Second, informal settlements’ remote sensing observation characteristics are highly inconspicuous, caused by the shooting angle and imaging environment. Therefore, it is inadequate to classify UIS using only a single remote sensing image modality. Multimodality data with multiple temporal and spatial characteristics provide a prospective opportunity for the more accurate mapping of UIS. Still, there is a lack of relevant works on UIS classification at present. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid Transformer-based spatio-temporal fusion network, namely, STNet, which integrates a proposed PDNet, ResMixer, and Transformer-based spatio-temporal fusing layer to classify UIS using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images and time-series Tencent population density (TPD) data. Experiments were conducted in Shenzhen City, confirming the superior performance of the proposed STNet and the fusing of spatio-temporal multimodal remote sensing and time-series TPD data. The proposed STNet reached an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.58% and Kappa of 0.7716, with increases of around 1% to 12% and around 0.03 to 0.25 in OA and Kappa, respectively, compared to other models.",

    "abstract": "The generation of topographic classification maps or relative heights from aerial or remote sensing images represents a crucial research tool in remote sensing. On the one hand, from auto-driving, three-dimensional city modeling, road design, and resource statistics to smart cities, each task requires relative height data and classification data of objects. On the other hand, most relative height data acquisition methods currently use multiple images. We find that relative height and geographic classification data can be mutually assisted through data distribution. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has become possible to estimate the relative height from a single image. It learns implicit mapping relationships in a data-driven manner that may not be explicitly available through mathematical modeling. On this basis, we propose a unified, in-depth learning structure that can generate both estimated relative height maps and semantically segmented maps and perform end-to-end training. Compared with the existing methods, our task is to perform both relative height estimation and semantic segmentation tasks simultaneously. We only need one picture to obtain the corresponding semantically segmented images and relative heights simultaneously. The model’s performance is much better than that of equivalent computational models. We also designed dynamic weights to enable the model to learn relative height estimation and semantic segmentation simultaneously. At the same time, we have conducted good experiments on existing datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Transformer-based network architecture is suitable for relative height estimation tasks and vastly outperforms other state-of-the-art DL (Deep Learning) methods.",

We find that relative height and geographic classification data can be mutually assisted through data distribution. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has become possible to estimate the relative height from a single image. It learns implicit mapping relationships in a data-driven manner that may not be explicitly available through mathematical modeling.",

    "abstract": "Under bad weather, the ability of intelligent vehicles to perceive the environment accurately is an important research content in many practical applications such as smart cities and unmanned driving. In order to improve vehicle environment perception technology in real hazy scenes, we propose an effective detection algorithm based on Swin Transformer for hazy vehicle detection. This algorithm includes two aspects. First of all, for the aspect of the difficulty in extracting haze features with poor visibility, a dehazing network is designed to obtain high-quality haze-free output through encoding and decoding methods using Swin Transformer blocks. In addition, for the aspect of the difficulty of vehicle detection in hazy images, a new end-to-end vehicle detection model in hazy days is constructed by fusing the dehazing module and the Swin Transformer detection module. In the training stage, the self-made dataset Haze-Car is used, and the haze detection model parameters are initialized by using the dehazing model and Swin-T through transfer learning. Finally, the final haze detection model is obtained by fine tuning. Through the joint learning of dehazing and object detection and comparative experiments on the self-made real hazy image dataset, it can be seen that the detection performance of the model in real-world scenes is improved by 12.5%.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable monitoring of traffic using clean energy supply has always been a significant problem for engineers. In this study, we proposed a self-powered smart transportation infrastructure skin (SSTIS) as an innovative and bionic system for the traffic classification of a smart city. This system incorporated the self-powered flexible sensors with net-zero power consumption based on the Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) and an intelligent analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI). The feasibility of the SSTIS was tested using the full-scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) and the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with a vehicle axle load classification accuracy up to 89.06%. This robust SSTIS was later tested on highway and collected around 869,600 pieces of signals data. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN - Gradient Penalty) was used for data augmentation, due to the imbalanced data of different vehicle types in actual traffic. The overall accuracy for on-road vehicle type classification improved to 81.06% using the convolutional neural network ResNet. Finally, we developed a mobile traffic signal information monitoring system based on cloud platform and Android framework, which enabled engineers to obtain the vehicle axle-load information mobilely.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent city construction and public crisis management. Distinct from the single trajectory prediction which rely on strong temporal correlation, in the complex scenes, the trajectory reflects not only the temporal characteristics of a single person, but the interactive features between human and other moving objects nearby. Therefore, how to deeply describe such temporality and interactivity, and then to generate accurate trajectory prediction results according to the change of the scene has become a major problem in the field of trajectory prediction today. In recent years, deep learning has attracted great attention and achieved success in the trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods capture the influence between pedestrians from a single view, and they fail to consider the multiple factors which have an effect on the decision of pedestrians, such as going straight or turning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time.",

    "abstract": "The production rate of crops is significantly declining due to natural disasters, animal interventions and plant diseases. Internet of things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks are widely applied in crop field monitoring systems to observe the quality of each plant and the field. This work proposes IoT based crop field protection system (ICFPS) that monitors and protects the crop fields from animal intrusions. This proposed system uses ultrasonic sensors, hyperspectral cameras, voice recorded buzzers and other agriculture sensors to protect the entire crop field. This system uses numerous sensor nodes and cameras for gathering field objects (images and environmental objects). The proposed ICFPS creates deep learning techniques such as recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNN) and recurrent generative adversarial neural networks (RGAN) for feature extraction, disease detection and field data monitoring practices. This proposed work develops a smart city-based agriculture system using cognitive learning approaches. This proposed system analyses crop field data and provide automatic alerts regarding animal interferences and crop diseases. Moreover, the cognitive smart crop field system observes various field conditions which support for good production rate. In this system, sensors and camera-enabled agriculture drones are coordinated with each other to collect the field data regularly. At the same time, the proposed work trains the RCNN and RGAN units using effective crop field datasets to attain realistic decisions within minimal time intervals. The experiment details and results show the proposed ICFPS works with 8%–10% of more classification accuracy than existing systems.",

    "abstract": "A smart city is an idea that is realized by the computing of a large amount of data collected through sensors, cameras, and other electronic methods to provide services, manage resources and solve daily life problems. The transformation of the conventional grid to a smart grid is one step in the direction towards smart city realization. An electric grid is composed of control stations, generation centres, transformers, communication lines, and distributors, which helps in transferring power from the power station to domestic and commercial consumers. Present electric grids are not smart enough that they can estimate the varying power requirement of the consumer. Also, these conventional grids are not enough robust and scalable. This has become the motivation for shifting from a conventional grid to a smart grid. The smart grid is a kind of power grid, which is robust and adapts itself to the varying needs of the consumer and self-healing in nature. In this way, the transformation from a conventional grid to a smart grid will help the government to make a smart city. The emergence of machine learning has helped in the prediction of the stability of the grid under the dynamically changing requirement of the consumer. Also, the usage of a variety of sensors will help in the collection of real-time consumption data. Through machine learning algorithms, we can gain an insight view of the collected data. This has helped the smart grid to convert into a robust smart grid, as this will help in avoiding the situation of failure. In this work, the authors have applied logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, naïve Bayes, random forest, and k-nearest neighbour algorithms to predict the stability of the grid. The authors have used the smart grid stability dataset freely available on Kaggle to train and test the models. It has been found that a model designed using the support vector machine algorithm has given the most accurate result.",

The smart grid is a kind of power grid, which is robust and adapts itself to the varying needs of the consumer and self-healing in nature. In this way, the transformation from a conventional grid to a smart grid will help the government to make a smart city. The emergence of machine learning has helped in the prediction of the stability of the grid under the dynamically changing requirement of the consumer. Also, the usage of a variety of sensors will help in the collection of real-time consumption data. Through machine learning algorithms, we can gain an insight view of the collected data. This has helped the smart grid to convert into a robust smart grid, as this will help in avoiding the situation of failure.",

Biometric analysis, education, security, healthcare, and smart cities are only a few examples of speech recognition applications. Most studies have mainly concentrated on English, Spanish, Japanese, or Chinese, disregarding other low-resource languages, such as Uzbek, leaving their analysis open. In this paper, we propose an End-To-End Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model speech recognition model and a hybrid Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-attention network for the Uzbek language and its dialects. The proposed approach reduces training time and improves speech recognition accuracy by effectively using CTC objective function in attention model training. We evaluated the linguistic and lay-native speaker performances on the Uzbek language dataset, which was collected as a part of this study. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved a word error rate of 14.3% using 207 h of recordings as an Uzbek language training dataset.",

    "abstract": "Cases of missing children not being found are rare, but they continue to occur. If the child is not found immediately, the parents may not be able to identify the child’s appearance because they have not seen their child for a long time. Therefore, our purpose is to predict children’s faces when they grow up and help parents search for missing children. DNA paternity testing is the most accurate way to detect whether two people have a blood relation. However, DNA paternity testing for every unidentified child would be costly. Therefore, we propose the development of the Face Prediction System for Missing Children in a Smart City Safety Network. It can predict the faces of missing children at their current age, and parents can quickly confirm the possibility of blood relations with any unidentified child. The advantage is that it can eliminate incorrect matches and narrow down the search at a low cost. Our system combines StyleGAN2 and FaceNet methods to achieve prediction. StyleGAN2 is used to style mix two face images. FaceNet is used to compare the similarity of two face images. Experiments show that the similarity between predicted and expected results is more than 75%. This means that the system can well predict children’s faces when they grow up. Our system has more natural and higher similarity comparison results than Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder (CAAE), High Resolution Face Age Editing (HRFAE) and Identity-Preserved Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (IPCGAN).",

An edge computing-based deep reinforcement learning system is demonstrated in this study that appropriately designs a multiobjective reward function for optimizing different objectives. The system seeks to overcome the challenge of evaluating actions with a simple numerical reward. The selection of reward functions has a significant impact on agents' ability to acquire the ideal behavior for managing multiple traffic signals in a large-scale road network. To ascertain effective reward functions, the agent is trained withusing the proximal policy optimization method in several deep neural network models, including the state-of-the-art transformer network. The system is verified using both hypothetical scenarios and real-world traffic maps. The comprehensive simulation outcomes demonstrate the potency of the suggested reward functions.",

Remote sensing images have the advantages of wide spatial coverage and rich information, and it is suitable for use as research data for smart cities. However, due to limitations in the imaging sensor conditions and complex weather, remote sensing images face the problems of insufficient resolution and cloud occlusion, which cannot meet the resolution requirements of smart city tasks. The remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) technique can improve the details and texture information without upgrading the imaging sensor system, which becomes a feasible solution for the above problems. In this paper, we propose a novel remote sensing image super-resolution method which leverages the texture features from internal and external references to help with SR reconstruction. We introduce the transformer attention mechanism to select and extract parts of texture features with high reference values to ensure that the network is lightweight, effective, and easier to deploy on edge computing devices. In addition, our network can automatically learn and adjust the alignment angles and scales of texture features for better SR results. Extensive comparison experiments show that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art SR methods. In addition, we also evaluate the application value of our proposed SR method in urban region function recognition in smart cities. The dataset used in this task is low-quality. The comparative experiment between the original dataset and the SR dataset generated by our proposed SR method indicates that our method can effectively improve the recognition accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification (ReID) focuses on searching for images of the same vehicle across different cameras and can be considered as the most fine-grained ID-level classification task. It is fundamentally challenging due to the significant differences in appearance presented by a vehicle with the same ID (especially from different viewpoints) coupled with the subtle differences between vehicles with different IDs. Spatial attention mechanisms that have been proven to be effective in computer vision tasks also play an important role in vehicle ReID. However, they often require expensive key-point labels or suffer from noisy attention masks when trained without key-point labels. In this work, we propose a transformer-based attention network (TAN) for learning spatial attention information and hence for facilitating learning of discriminative features for vehicle ReID. Specifically, in contrast to previous studies that adopted a transformer network, we designed the attention network as an independent branch that can be flexibly utilized in various tasks. Moreover, we combined the TAN with two other branches: one to extract global features that define the image-level structures, and the other to extract the auxiliary side-attribute features that are invariant to viewpoint, such as color, car type, etc. To validate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on two vehicle datasets (the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets) and a person dataset (Market-1501). The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed TAN is effective in improving the performance of both the vehicle and person ReID tasks, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perfomance.",

    "abstract": "Occupant activities in buildings are connected by different transportation measures. For smart communities, it is possible to synergize the energy management of smart buildings with the vehicle operation/travel information available from transportation infrastructure, e.g. the intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Such information enables the prediction of upcoming building occupancy and upcoming charging load of electric vehicles (EVs). This paper presents a predictive energy management strategy for smart community, which features water-based district cooling for a cluster of buildings driven by a multi-chiller central plant, and each building hosts a number of EV charging stations. A scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (SCMPC) framework, in which the upcoming building occupancy and charging load, ambient temperature, humidity and solar irradiance are assumed to be stochastically predictable. The SCMPC targets demand response operation at community level, involving both time-of-use and demand charges, and the combined power consumption by the central plant and EV charging observing to the transformer limit as a coupled constraint. To evaluate the propagation of the above uncertain factors through the receding-horizon SCMPC process, moving-horizon probabilistic models are established for EV arrival information. By developing a functional mockup interface (FMI) based co-simulation platform developed with Modelica and Python, the proposed method is validated via simulation study, and the performance indices are evaluated.",

For these tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the dominant solution for the past decade, for their remarkable ability in learning discriminative features from images to boost retrieval performance. However, it is been discovered that DNNs are broadly vulnerable to maliciously constructed adversarial examples. By adding small perturbations to a query image, the returned retrieval results will be completely dissimilar from the query image. This poses serious challenges to vital systems in Smart City applications that depend on the DNN-based visual retrieval technology, as in the physical world, simple camouflage can be added on the subject (a few patches on the body or car), and turn the subject completely untrackable by person or vehicle Re-ID systems. To demonstrate the potential of such threats, this paper proposes a novel adversarial patch generative adversarial network (AP-GAN) to generate adversarial patches instead of modifying the entire image, which also causes the DNNs-based image retrieval models to return incorrect results. AP-GAN is trained in an unsupervised way that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once trained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries. Extensive experiments show that the AP-GAN achieves excellent attacking performance with various application scenarios that are based on deep features, including image retrieval, person ReID and vehicle ReID. The results of this study provide a warning that when deploying a DNNs-based image retrieval system, its security and robustness needs to be thoroughly considered.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image scene classification is an important and challenging problem of remote sensing image interpretation. With the generation of a large number of scene-rich high-resolution remote sensing images, scene classification of remote sensing images is widely used in many fields such as smart city construction, natural disaster monitoring and land resource utilization. Due to the advancement of deep learning techniques and the establishment of large-scale scene classification datasets, scene classification methods have been significantly improved. Although the classification methods based on deep learning have achieved high classification accuracy, the supervised methods require a large number of training samples, while the unsupervised classification methods are difficult to meet the practical needs and have low classification accuracy. Meanwhile, the annotation of remote sensing images requires rich engineering skills and expert knowledge, and in remote sensing applications, only a small amount of labeled remote sensing images exist for supervised training in most cases, and a large amount of unlabeled images cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, a semi-supervised learning method that extracts effective features from a large amount of unlabeled data by learning a small amount of labeled data becomes a potential way to solve such problems. To address the problems of complex background of remote sensing images and the inability of supervised scene classification algorithms to utilize unlabeled data, a semi-supervised remote sensing image scene classification method based on generative adversarial networks, namely, residual attention generative adversarial networks, is proposed. First, to enhance the stability of training, the residual blocks with jump structure are introduced in the deep neural network. At the same time, the spectral normalization constrains the spectral norm of the weight matrix in each convolutional layer of the residual block to ensure that the input and output of each batch of data satisfy the 1-Lipschitz continuity, which makes the generative adversarial training always smooth, not only improves the training stability, but also avoids network degradation. Secondly, since the shallow features extracted by the bottom convolution contain mostly local information and low semantics, while the deep features extracted by the top convolution contain more global information but lose part of the detail information. Therefore, the shallow features are fused with the deep features extracted from the multi-layer spectral normalized residual blocks to reduce the loss of features and allow the model to learn the complementary relationships between different features, thus improving the model's representational ability. Finally, to guide the model to focus more purposefully on important features and suppress unnecessary features, an attention module that mimics the signal processing of the human brain is used. Meanwhile, in order to obtain stronger feature representation ability and capture the dependency relationship between features, a gating mechanism is introduced to form an attention module combined with gating. To verify the superiority of the method, experiments were conducted on two high-resolution remote sensing image datasets, EuroSAT and UC Merced. In the EuroSAT dataset, the highest classification accuracy reached 93.3% and 97.4% when the number of labeled features was 2 000 and 21 600, respectively. In the UC Merced dataset, the classification accuracies reached 85.7% and 91.0% when the number of labeled was 400 and 1 680, respectively. To further validate the degree of contribution of each module, ablation experiments were also conducted in the EuroSAT and UCM public datasets, and it can be concluded from the validation that the spectral normalization residual module has the largest contribution, with improvement for different number of labeled samples. The reason is that the spectral normalization ensures that the gradient of the network is limited to a certain range during backpropagation, improving the stability of the generative adversarial network, and also does not destroy the network structure in the process. The next is the attention module combined with gating, especially when the labeled sample size is greater than 10%, the classification effect is improved more because the sample size is sufficient to learn more comprehensive features. The smallest contribution is the feature fusion module, because when the sample size is very small, the network is not sufficiently trained and learned, and a part of redundant or invalid features are extracted, resulting in lower classification accuracy. The above experimental results show that the proposed residual attention generation adversarial network classification method can effectively extract more discriminative features and improve the semi-supervised classification performance for the problem of small sample size of labeled high-resolution remote sensing images, which makes it difficult to extract discriminative features.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the underlying patterns of the urban mobility dynamics is essential for both the traffic state estimation and management of urban facilities and services. Due to the coupling relationship of generative factors in spatial-temporal domain, it is challenging to model the citywide traffic dynamics under a structural pattern of critical features such as hours of days, days of weeks and weather conditions. To address this challenge, this article develops a disentangled representation learning framework to learn an interpretable factorized representation of the independent data generative factors. In order to make full use of the knowledge on generative factors, this article proposes spatial-temporal generative adversarial network (ST-GAN) to assign the generative factors of traffic flow to the feature vector in latent space and reconstructs the high-dimensional citywide traffic flow from the given factors. With the help of the disentangled representations, the decomposed feature vector in latent space discloses the relationship between underlying patterns and citywide traffic dynamics. Several comprehensively experiments show that ST-GAN not only effectively improves the prediction accuracy but also promisingly characterize structural properties of the traffic evolution process.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive medium access control (MAC) protocols are essential in the context of Vehicular AdHoc Networks (Vanets) because of the rapid changes in topology caused by the high mobility of nodes. In this work, we propose an adaptive version of the Slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA) protocol, where the transmission probability is constantly adjusted based on estimates of the number of vehicles in the coverage area. These values are computed using deep learning models for time series prediction. One challenge for implementing this approach is that the inputs to the models are noisy since they are also estimates based on the protocol's operation itself. To address this problem, we propose a new training scheme where we add noise, similar to that produced by the protocol's operation, to the inputs of the training examples as a form of regularization. Our experiments show that the regularized models perform close to the theoretical optimal where the number of vehicles in the area is always known.",

    "abstract": "Urban flow prediction plays a crucial role in public transportation management and smart city construction. Although previous studies have achieved success in integrating spatial-temporal information to some extents, those models lack thoughtful consideration on global information and positional information in the temporal dimension, which can be summarized by three aspects: a) The models do not consider the relative position information of time axis, resulting in that the position features of flow maps are not effectively learned. b) They overlook the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales, which lead to inaccurate global information representation. c) Those models only predict the flow map at the end of time sequence other than more flow maps before that, which results in neglecting parts of temporal features in the learning process. To solve the problems, we propose a novel model, Spatial-Temporal Global Semantic representation learning for urban flow Prediction (ST-GSP) in this paper. Specifically, for a), we design a semantic flow encoder that extracts relative positional information of time. Besides, the encoder captures the spatial dependencies and external factors of urban flow at each time interval. For b), we model the correlation among temporal dependencies of different scales simultaneously by using the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which can learn the global temporal dependencies. For c), inspired by the idea of self-supervised learning, we mask an urban flow map on the time sequence and predict it to pre-train a deep bidirectional learning model to catch the representation from its context. We conduct extensive experiments on two types of urban flows in Beijing and New York City to show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The power grid, one of the most crucial components of smart cities, faces significant challenges in operating efficiently, dependably, and economically. One of these challenges is forecasting the demand for electricity. Grid managers can balance supply and demand properly while also minimizing operating expenses for generating and transmitting power. Thanks to accurate forecasts, while maintaining respectable system performance in terms of the limitations on the actual and reactive power output of the generator, bus voltages, shunt capacitors and reactors, transformer tap setting, and transmission line power flow. For a sustainable future and to meet the higher carbon emission standards that are being put in place, it is expected that the renewable energy sector will experience enormous development. The placement of wind turbines in a wind farm requires the use of evolutionary algorithms and power system optimization issues because the wake effect caused by upstream turbines impacts the output of downstream turbines, consequently diminishing the total power output from the wind farm. The current study using MFO determines a cost of $ 3160.0824 $/h for minimizing the cost of multiple fuels, which turns out to be the best price when compared to the legitimate results obtained by other algorithms. It results in a cost savings of 1.45% per hour when compared to the worst alternatives given by the comparison algorithm. According to simulation results on the IEEE 30-bus network with six generators, this approach might offer the best solution right away. A further study found that this method works best for medium-scale power installations.",

    "abstract": "Global energy demand is increasing continuously due to growth in the world population and industrial developments. In a parallel dimension, the problem of decreasing CO2 emissions in smart cities is becoming a priority. Forecasting energy consumption is essential for implementing a decarbonization plan in a smart city. The energy consumption forecasting problem has some challenges because of lacking appropriate data, including energy consumption patterns in the energy sector. In such a context, in this study, we focus on short-term time series forecasting for energy consumption tasks with comprehensive data. We employed LSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, and hybrid models to predict energy consumption via time series. The models were tested on the JERICHO-E-usage Germany dataset for Berlin, Düsseldorf, and the whole of Germany. We executed an energy consumption forecasting pipeline in our experiments to summarize Information and Communication Technology and Lighting energy types. Finally, we presented a comparative analysis between state-of-art deep learning and machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer, XGBoost), and a hybrid model. The proposed energy consumption forecasting pipeline can be applied to various countries and cities based on geographical distributions.",

    "abstract": "The growing number of drone serving in Smart Cities make it increasingly necessary to develop new technologies to assist traffic management in low-altitude airspace. The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a layered network providing efficient and safe airways for various drone inter-operable services. Automated Drone Classification (ADC) is a prerequisite in the IoD system that not only monitors flights and avoids collisions between drones but also detects malicious drone flights. In this work, we propose a Dual-stream Convolutional Transformer (DCT) model to carry out ADC tasks based on drone remote control signals. The DCT combines the self-attention mechanism and convolution to capture long-range dependencies of different frequencies/time steps and local invariant features. We evaluated the proposed method on two public datasets and compared the results with the baseline studies. The DCT model outperforms other baselines with the improvement of 3 % accuracy in multiclass classification and reaches 94.49 % and 98.73 % on two different datasets at 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the experiments also show the great potential of DCT model on out-of-distribution by the improvement of 7 % accuracy. The above results demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising solution for supporting the ADC task in reliable, fast, and inexpensive ways.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification (ReID) is a critical technology in smart city and has drawn much attention. Many studies focus on single-modal (i.e., visible) vehicle re-identification, which are prone to be deteriorated under bad illumination conditions. Therefore, visible, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared multi-modal vehicle re-identification is worthy to study. This paper proposes a hybrid vision transformer (H-ViT) based multi-modal vehicle re-identification. The proposed H-ViT has two new modules: (1) modal-specific controller (MC) and (2) modal information embedding (MIE) structure. In the feature extraction process, the MC flexibly specifies modal-specific layers for different modal data and controls the sharing attribute of the position embedding to alleviate the difficulty brought by heterogeneous multi-modalities. The MIE structure learns inter- and intra-modal information to reduce feature deviations toward modal variations. Experimental results show that our H-ViT method achieves good performance on multi-modal vehicle re-identification datasets (i.e., RGBNT100 and RGBN300) by integrating MC and MIE modules, which are superior to existing algorithms.",

We designed a distributed IDS controller validated over dataset of NSL-KDD and proven with higher performance in detecting the DDOS Distributed-Denial-of service-attacks. Thus, Experimental Results are calculated with predefined threshold values to detect DDoS-attacks and the resultant proves that HD-GAN model offers better intrusion detection with respect to higher accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure, and lower FPR (False-Positive-Rate).",

We have proposed on an anomaly Hybrid based deep learning-based approach which is Generative Adversarial Network in accordance with detecting malicious intruders. We designed a distributed IDS controller validated over dataset of NSL-KDD and proven with higher performance in detecting the DDOS Distributed-Denial-of service-attacks. Thus, Experimental Results are calculated with predefined threshold values to detect DDoS-attacks and the resultant proves that HD-GAN model offers better intrusion detection with respect to higher accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure, and lower FPR (False-Positive-Rate).",

    "abstract": "While smart cities have the required infrastructure for traffic prediction, underdeveloped cities lack the budget and technology to perform an accurate model. Current research uses data mining of tweets and specific posts to provide population trends, but there is no work done in social network analysis for the same end. This paper proposes an applied informatics application with social network usage to aid in the lack of data due to nonexistent traffic sensors. The Twitter API was used to download a network of users that follows traffic updates accounts and then, use a model of information diffusion (independent cascade model) to retrieve a variable that holds a metric of how the information regarding current traffic has traveled through the network. Finally, an updated traffic dataset with the new social network variable is used to train and validate an LSTM neural network to show if the new variable can be a predictor for traffic. Results show that a deterministic independent cascade model ran on a New York City-based 2-tier social network marginally improved the prediction by 0.4%. This proposal can be replicated in other information diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "The number of LoRaWAN networks have grown worldwide last years, offering a solution for the integration of the Internet of Things in rural and urban areas. After years of development, several performance issues and scalability limitations require to be enhanced for LoRa such as high collision rates and duty cycle limitations. Machine learning offers a chance for LoRaWAN to rise as the reference communication technology that offers the adequate communication performances for IoT. In this paper, our goal is to optimize the LoRaWAN network performances using detection mechanism and artificial intelli-gence to predict its behavior. first, we evaluate the full potential of the LoRaWAN factory setting, and we introduced a Quality of Service demanding application. Second, we constructed our proper database using available application criteria, we included a quality of service mechanism to simulate the effect of a new application connecting to a stable network and the perturbing causes. Then, we used two different methods one for classification, the second for prediction, and then the optimization. For clas-sification using Auto-Regressive and optimization it using burg algorithm and firefly algorithm, then we used the support vector machine for traffic classification, results are very promising, we were able to detect normal traffic, a normal surge, and an abnormal surge of network traffic with up to 99% accuracy. For prediction, we used a new algorithm developed by google Temporal Fusion Transformer. We were able to predict the network behaviour ahead with 14 days with 95% accuracy and up to 30 days with 80% accuracy. We were able to optimize the network to absorb the abnormal surge and return to normal in less than 60% of the normal time, uplifting the packet delivery ratio for uplink traffic by 20% and downlink traffic by 50%.",

One relevant application task based on this type of data is destination prediction, where movement data are used to form highly customized models that can forecast intended user destinations based on partially observed trajectories. In this work, we present a two-stage predictive model for destination prediction and Time-To-Destination (TTD) estimation using movement trajectories and contextual information. Our two-stage approach uses a Transformer-based architecture to predict an intended destination and a regression model to estimate how many steps must be traversed before a destination is reached. We showcase experimental results on various trajectory datasets and show that our proposed approach is able to yield significant destination prediction improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods and can also produce accurate TTD estimates.",

    "abstract": "An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is one of the core elements of smart cities, enhancing public safety and relieving traffic congestion. Detection and classification of critical vehicles, such as police cars and ambulances, passing through roadways form crucial use cases for ITS. This paper proposes a solution for detecting and classifying safety-critical vehicles on urban roadways using deep learning models. At present, a large-scale dataset for critical vehicles is not publicly available. The appearance scarcity of emergency vehicles and different coloring standards in various countries are significant challenges. To cope with the mentioned drawbacks and to address the unique requirements of our smart city project, we first generate a large-scale critical vehicle dataset, combining images retrieved from various sources with the support of the YOLO vehicle detection model. The classes of the generated dataset are: fire truck, police car, ambulance, military police car, dangerous truck, and standard vehicle. Second, we compare the performance of the Vision in Transformer (ViT) network against the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of critical vehicle classification. Experimental results on our dataset reveal that the ViT-based solution reaches an average accuracy and recall of 99.39% and 99.34%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Person re-identification plays an important role in the construction of the smart city. A reliable person re-identification system relieves users from the inefficient work of identifying the specific individual from enormous numbers of photos or videos captured by different surveillance devices. The most existing methods either focus on local discriminative features without global contextual information or scatter global features while ignoring the local features, resulting in ineffective attention to irregular pedestrian zones. In this article, a novel Transformer-CNN Coupling Network (TCCNet) is proposed to capture the fluctuant body region features in a heterogeneous feature-aware manner. We employ two bridging modules, the Lowlevel Feature Coupling Module (LFCM) and the High-level Feature Coupling Module (HFCM), to improve the complementary characteristics of the hybrid network. It is significantly helpful to enhance the capacity to distinguish between foreground and background features, thereby reducing the unfavorable impact of cluttered backgrounds on person re-identification. Furthermore, the duplicate loss for the two branches is employed to incorporate semantic information from distant preferences of the two branches into the resulting person representation. The experiments on two large-scale person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TCCNet achieves competitive results compared with several state-of-the-art approaches. The mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-1 identification rate on the MSMT17 dataset achieve 66.9% and 84.5%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In smart surveillance systems, event classification and detection are essential parts, on the other hand, violent event recognition is one of the most important key elements in that systems. The use of the transformer network for video action recognition has achieved very high results, On the other hand, the transformer network needs a large amount of data to gain good accuracy therefore, a new family of video transformer networks called Data-efficient video transformer (DEVTr) came to address these problems and shows that the use of the pre-trained convolution neural network in the embedding stage can improve accuracy with the use of a small dataset for the given task. In this study, we extend the data-efficient video transformer (DEVTr) for better event detection within a small dataset and with low hardware resources. We also introduced two new video data augmentations methods (random erase from frames and frame position shifting with blurring). The model achieved 98.25% accuracy on the Real-life violence dataset (RLVS), an accuracy of 96% on the NTU CCTV-fight dataset, and accuracy of 91.803% on the UBI-Fight dataset. A comparison with previous techniques illustrated that the proposed methods provide the best result among the other research for violence event detection within a small dataset and low hardware resources.",

The use of the transformer network for video action recognition has achieved very high results, On the other hand, the transformer network needs a large amount of data to gain good accuracy therefore, a new family of video transformer networks called Data-efficient video transformer (DEVTr) came to address these problems and shows that the use of the pre-trained convolution neural network in the embedding stage can improve accuracy with the use of a small dataset for the given task.",

    "abstract": "Accurate multi-step citywide urban flow prediction plays a critical role in traffic management and future smart city. However, it is very challenging since urban flow is affected by complex semantic factors and has multi-scale dependencies on both spatial and temporal dimensional features. Moreover, it’s difficult for most existing one-step urban flow prediction models to predict several future time steps in a short time accurately. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in video prediction and image generation, in this paper we propose a Seq2Seq Spatial-Temporal Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks named STS-GAN for multi-step urban flow prediction. We regard citywide urban flow data in successive time steps as image frames of a video. Specifically, we first design a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Encoder (STSE) to capture relative semantic factors and spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously at each time step, which consists of Residual Convolution units. Then a Seq2Seq GAN model is proposed to generate a sequence of future urban flow predictions based on historical data. Furthermore, by integrating GAN’s adversarial loss with prediction error, our STS-GAN can effectively address the blurry prediction issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale urban flow datasets in Beijing and Guangzhou, which demonstrate STS-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods.",

The Transformer, which has demonstrated superiority in capturing long-term dependencies, was recently studied for spatio-temporal prediction.

    "abstract": "The intelligent load forecasting is an important part of smart cities, used for the purpose of energy management in an efficient manner. However, there is not much research done on this aspect of energy management (EM) in smart cities, with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, a new deep learning (DL) methodology is used for predicting the amount of energy consumed within a short period of time, while maintaining proper communication between the users and energy providers. There are multiple stacked spatiotemporal modules present in the Energy-Net stack such that every module is made up of a Spatial Transformer and a Temporal Transformer (TT) sub-module. The temporal relationships are denoted in the TT model while the ST model uses the integration of convolutional layers to extract the hidden spatial information. Experimental observations on the datasets indicate that this methodology proves to be superior when compared with other existing DL methods that have an RMSE of 0.535 and 0.354. Energy Net computational complexity is suitable for IoT devices with dependable resource constraints, in collaboration with IoT cloud server to communicate with the smart grids to manage energy-related tasks.",

So LV grid is taken in consideration to understand the impact of charging electric vehicles. As loads is connected to different phases, so there will be a phase asymmetry in the network. This asymmetry can be reduced by proper planning of the grid. Injection of electrical vehicle into the grid will also have an impact on power factor. As some consumers turn on or off their electric vehicles, the overall power factor changes. This has to be considered as this impact the reactive power consumption.

    "abstract": "A Micro grid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within a clearly defined electrical boundaries that act as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. In AC and DC Micro grids multiple reverse conversions are required in an individual AC/DC loads. This may add additional losses to the system operation and make current home and office appliances more complicated. As a result, system co-ordination becomes too difficult in conventional micro grid. To overcome this drawbacks, hybrid micro grid which is an integral part of the smart grid is the most suitable solution to provide for the increasing penetration of DC-compatible energy sources, storage and loads which is recently prevalent in all Electric Power Industries. One of the most important feature of hybrid micro grid is advanced structure which can facilitate the connection of various AC, DC generation systems with optimal asset utilization and operation efficiency. It consists of both AC and DC networks connected together by multi bi-directional converters. AC sources and loads are connected to the AC networks. Similarly DC sources and loads are connected to the DC networks. Energy storage system can be connected to the DC or AC links. In this paper DC/DC converter with High frequency transformer is used to replace a normal conventional bulky transformer for bus voltage matching and galvanic isolation. Among different DHFT topologies, CLLC-TYPE has been suggested for its bidirectional power flow, seamless transition and low switching losses. DHFT open-loop control has been performed to simplify the systematic co-ordination and provide a smooth power transfer between AC/DC links. It has been designed in order to maximize the conversion efficiency and minimize the output voltage variations in different load conditions. Thus the hybrid micro grid has been simulated and analyzed using Simulink in MATLAB.",

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning technologies generally learn the features of chest X-ray data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia). A large number of truthful reports make the verification of our model can effectively diagnose COVID-19 without compromising privacy.",

In order to quickly respond to disasters in smart cities, high-rise wide-angle CCTVs that enable control from a new perspective must be able to collect image information, and continuous control using LSTM-based edge computing should be operated to quickly detect disasters and effectively respond to disasters.

    "abstract": "Advances in the Internet of Things have enabled the development of many smart city applications and expert systems that help citizens and authorities better understand the dynamics of the cities, and make better planning and utilisation of city resources. Smart cities are composed of complex systems that usually process and analyse big data from the Cyber, Physical, and Social worlds. Traffic event detection is an important and complex task in smart transportation modelling and management. We address this problem using semi-supervised deep learning with data of different modalities, e.g., physical sensor observations and social media data. Unlike most existing studies focusing on data of single modality, the proposed method makes use of data of multiple modalities that appear to complement and reinforce each other. Meanwhile, as the amount of labelled data in big data applications is usually extremely limited, we extend the multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network model to a semi-supervised architecture to characterise traffic events. We evaluate the model with a large, real-world dataset consisting of traffic sensor observations and social media data collected from the San Francisco Bay Area over a period of four months. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in extracting and classifying traffic events.",

    "abstract": "When considering the new standards of a smart city and its power systems, special focus is given to the power transformer and its control and monitoring systems as well as load management. After all, at the moment this link is most vulnerable to the factors of influence on the part of the energy source and its quality on the one hand and reasonable consumers of electricity on the other. As a result of working with the increasing load of components of a smart city, the probability of critical damage to the transformer and even its failure increases. Recent research is mostly based on the analysis of the spectral influence of current and voltage of smart network consumers on the distribution transformer. The order of definition of components of active and reactive power of the distributive transformer in the loading mode taking into account influence of nonlinear consumers of Smart Grid is offered as indicators of the state of the transformer winding. On the laboratory equipment performed modeling of the influence of Smart Grid users on the operation of a single-phase distribution transformer. The primary sequence of the experiment to study the energy performance of the distribution transformer in the mode of loading by nonlinear Smart Grid consumers has been developed. For this purpose, a model of a distribution transformer was built and the indicators of the harmonic spectra of the active and reactive power of the controlled windings were determined for all harmonics to be determined. The influence of DG on the harmonic power spectrum and its negative influence on the manifestation of harmonic monitors of components, namely harmonic components of 6th and 8th orders, is noted. The results of the study can be used as a tool that can serve as a mathematical assessment of the system of calculation and development of fault monitors based on the spectrally analyzed flow of power, current and voltage.",

    "abstract": "The ever-expanding applications of mobile crowdsensing have made scalable environment sensing possible by exploiting the power of ubiquitous smart devices. Nevertheless, the implementation of sensing applications in urban scale meets serious challenges in terms of sensing costs and quality. For example, data sparsity will arise due to sensing ability and cost, and the measurements could contain noise or errors. Therefore, missing data inference with low-quality measurements is critical. To tackle these challenges, we design a low-cost crowdsensing system by missing data inference incorporating with active sensing grids selection. Specifically, an adversarial autoencoder (AAE)-based scheme is proposed for missing data inference. This model applies VAE to learn latent variables and generates full data and further utilizes the adversarial nets to play a min-max game with the autoencoder. Furthermore, an active learning-based method is designed to iteratively select sensing grids to further reduce the cost. The proposed scheme can handle large missing rate, both random and block missing patterns, and is robust against measurement noise. Comprehensive experiments based on three data sets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous changes in the user-side power environment, the low-voltage distribution network has become more and more complex, which brings great challenges to the line loss management and topology identification of the transformer area. To solve the shortcomings of traditional particle swarm optimization such as poor ergodicity of population initialization and easy to fall into premature convergence, this paper proposed a K-means clustering analysis algorithm based on GA-CPSO. First, on the basis of the traditional particle swarm algorithm, the chaotic shrinkage factor was introduced and the parameters were optimized. Secondly, the genetic algorithm was combined with the chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm, the crossover and mutation operations of the genetic algorithm were used to establish an information exchange mechanism between particles, and it was combined with the K-means clustering method. The simulation results on the test benchmark function show that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm in this paper has significantly improved the search speed and optimization accuracy. Finally, taking an actual transformer area as an example, the method was applied to the transformer area topology recognition analysis. Using the electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and active power obtained from the monitoring terminal as sample data, a simulation analysis was carried out to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm. The performance parameters of different algorithms had been compared and analyzed through multiple experiments, and it was proved that this method can effectively improve the accuracy of platform topology recognition, and has strong practicability and generalization.",

The simulation results on the test benchmark function show that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm in this paper has significantly improved the search speed and optimization accuracy. Finally, taking an actual transformer area as an example, the method was applied to the transformer area topology recognition analysis. Using the electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and active power obtained from the monitoring terminal as sample data, a simulation analysis was carried out to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm. The performance parameters of different algorithms had been compared and analyzed through multiple experiments, and it was proved that this method can effectively improve the accuracy of platform topology recognition, and has strong practicability and generalization.",
    "introduction": "With the continuous changes in the user-side power environment, the low-voltage distribution network has become more and more complex, which brings great challenges to the line loss management and topology identification of the transformer area.",

    "abstract": "In smart cities, violence event detection is critical to ensure city safety. Several studies have been done on this topic with a focus on 2d-Convolutional Neural Network (2d-CNN) to detect spatial features from each frame, followed by one of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) variants as a temporal features learning method. On the other hand, the transformer network has achieved a great result in many areas. The bottleneck for transformers is the need for large data set to achieve good results. In this work, we propose a data-efficient video transformer (DeVTr) based on the transformer network as a Spatio-temporal learning method with a pre-trained 2d-Convolutional neural network (2d-CNN) as an embedding layer for the input data. The model has been trained and tested on the Real-life violence dataset (RLVS) and achieved an accuracy of 96.25%. A comparison of the result for the suggested method with previous techniques illustrated that the suggested method provides the best result among all the other studies for violence event detection.",

    "abstract": "With the massive deployment of 5G cellular infrastructures, traffic prediction has become an indispensable part of the cellular resource management system in order to provide reliable and fast communication services that can meet the increasing quality-of-service requirements of smart city. A promising approach for handling this problem is to introduce intelligent methods to implement a highly effective and efficient cellular traffic prediction model. Meanwhile, integrating the multiaccess edge computing framework in 5G cellular networks facilitates the application of intelligent traffic prediction models by enabling their implementation at the network edge. However, the data shortage and privacy issues may still be obstacles for training a robust and accurate prediction model at the edge. To address these issues, we propose a data-augmentation-based cellular traffic prediction model (ctGAN-S2S), where an effective data augmentation submodel based on generative adversarial networks is proposed to improve the prediction performance while protecting data privacy, and a long-short-term-memory-based sequence-to-sequence submodel is used to achieve the flexible multistep cellular traffic prediction. The experimental results on a real-world city-scale cellular traffic dataset reveal that our ctGAN-S2S model achieves up to 48.49% improvement of the prediction accuracy compared to four typical reference models.",

    "abstract": "Video Synopsis is a smart and efficient solution to summarize a long duration of surveillance video into short. Most of the video synopsis techniques are not suitable to address complex situations like changes in illumination, dynamic background, camera jitter, etc. These techniques firmly depend on the preprocessing results of foreground extraction and multiple objects tracking. Further, the optimization process is a vital phase for the decrement of collision rate among moving objects, where the widely used Simulated Annealing (SA) usually suffers from the issue of slow convergence rate with a high computational overhead. Taking these aforementioned facts into account for feature extraction, we formulate a foreground extraction scheme exploring the concept of multi-frame and multi-scale in Generative Adversarial Network (mFS-GANs). Further, an optimization algorithm is proposed through the hybridization of SA and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), named as, HGWOSA to ensure global optimal result with a low computing overhead. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared with that of the benchmark schemes. The experiments are carried out using some standard surveillance video dataset (ChangeDetection.Net, MIT Surveillance Dataset, and UMN Dataset) and one self-generated surveillance video at IIIT Bhubaneswar. Overall analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the other competing schemes in terms of both the quantitative and qualitative measures. Finally, the proposed model can be substantially employed in the generation of off-line video synopsis, which is potentially applicable to video surveillance applications for smart cities.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the current situation of large power consumption of terminal, slow transmission speed, difficulty in upgrading and maintenance, and no security encryption in the establishment of the access network from the macro base station to the power load control management terminal using 230MHz digital radio wireless technology, a network based on 5G communication technology is proposed. The 5G embedded terminal is connected to the 5G cell base station to realize the dedicated transformer collection terminal and the power load control management terminal to connect to the main station of the power load management system. At the same time, the secure encryption terminal is used to cooperate with the secure access gateway to achieve the security encryption goal of power business data.

    "abstract": "Objective: Remote sensing building object segmentation is one of the important applications in image processing, which plays a vital role in smart city planning and urban change detection. However, building objects in remote sensing images have many complex characteristics, such as variable sizes, dense distributions, diverse topological shapes, complex backgrounds, and presence of occlusions and shadows. Traditional building segmentation algorithms are mainly based on manually designed features such as shapes, edges, and shadow features. These features are shallow features of the building target and cannot well express high-level semantic information, resulting in low recognition accuracy. By contrast, deep convolutional networks show excellent performance in pixel-level classification of natural images. Various fully convolutional network based image segmentation models have been continuously proposed. Most of these models use deconvolution or bilinear interpolation after feature extraction. Feature upsampling and pixel-by-pixel classification are used to segment the input image. The deep features of the building are extracted using highly nonlinear mapping and a large amount of data training, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional algorithms. However, upsampling cannot completely compensate the information loss caused by repeated convolution and pooling operations in the deep convolutional network model. Therefore, the prediction results are relatively rough, such as small target misclassification, inaccurate boundaries, and other issues. In the field of remote sensing, public data sets are few. Training excellent deep convolutional networks is difficult, and the robustness of the network needs to be further improved. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a conditional generative adversarial network (Ra-CGAN) with multilevel channel attention mechanism to segment remote sensing building objects. Method: A generative model with a multilevel channel attention mechanism is first built. The model is based on a coding and decoding structure that solves small target misses by fusing deep semantics and shallow details with attention. Second, a discriminative network is built and used to distinguish whether the input comes from the real label map or the segmentation map generated by the model. The segmentation result (accuracy and smoothness) is improved by correcting the difference between the two maps. The downsampling method without pooling is used in the discriminator to enhance the propagation of the gradient. Finally, the generated model and the discriminant model are alternately confronted for training through the constraint of the conditional variable of the labelled image. Learning the higher-order data distribution characteristics results in more continuity for the target space. The loss function uses a hybrid loss function, which comes from the cross-entropy loss function brought by the generated map and the real label map in the generation mode. The discriminator predicts the generated image as the loss value brought by the real label image. Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets. The first dataset has a dense building with many types and accurate labels, and can provide comprehensive, representative evaluation capabilities for the model. Another dataset with a higher segmentation difficulty is used to verify the robustness and scalability of the model. The lighting information and background information of the building are more complex than those of the first dataset. The experiment uses the PyTorch deep learning framework. The size of original image and the label image are unified to 512 × 512 pixels for training, the learning rate of Adam is set to 0.000 2, the momentum parameter is 0.5, the batch-size is 12, and the epoch is 200 times. Acceleration is performed using NVIDIA GTX TITAN Xp. Evaluation indicators include intersection over union (IOU), precision, recall, and F1-score. Result: Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets, and the methods are compared with the latest literature. Experimental results show that in the WHU dataset, the segmentation performance of the Ra-CGAN model is substantially improved compared with models without attention mechanism and adversarial training. Space continuity and integrity of the complex building and small building, and smoothness of building edges are considerably improved. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 3.75%, and F1-score is increased by 2.52%. Compared with the second-performance model, IOU value is increased by 1.1%, and F1-score is increased by 1.1%. In the Satellite Dataset II, Ra-CGAN obtains more ideal results in terms of target integrity and smoothness than other models, especially in the case of insufficient data samples. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 7.26%, and F1-score is increased by 6.68%. Compared with the second-placed model, IOU value is increased by 1.7% and F1-score is increased by 1.6%. Conclusion: A CGAN remote sensing building object segmentation model with multilevel channel attention mechanism, which combines the advantages of multilevel channel attention mechanism generation model and conditional generative adversarial networks, is proposed. Experimental results show that our model is superior to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Much more accurate remote sensing building object segmentation results are obtained on different datasets, proving that the model exhibits better robustness and scalability.",

On the other hand, while smart cities bring better life experiences and great convenience to people's lives, there are more hidden dangers of cyber security, including information leakage and malicious cyber attacks. The current cyber security development cannot keep up with the eager adoption of global smart city technologies so correct design based on deep learning methods is essential to protect smart city cyber. This paper summarizes the knowledge and interpretation of Smart Cities (SC), Cyber Security (CS), and Deep Learning (DL) concepts as well as discussed existing related work on IoT security in smart cities. Specifically, we briefly reviewed several deep learning models, including Boltzmann machines, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. Then we introduced cyber security applications and use cases based on deep learning technology in smart cities. Finally, we describe the future development trend of smart city cyber security.",

This fact led researchers to propose various topologies of transformer-less inverters, which have been validated for only injection of real power towards grid. However, recently new regulation has been imposed by all international power regulatory agency is that these PV inverters integrated with grid should have the capability of handling flow of a certain quantity of reactive power. By considering this point, a noble topology of transformer-less inverter has been developed for grid integrated PV system.

    "abstract": "Power transformer has an important role in a transmission system. One factor that can reduce efficiency in the transmission system is transmission losses. Efficiency can be increased by reducing losses in the power transformer. The biggest influence determining the losses on the transformer is the material characteristic used by the transformer itself. To get maximum efficiency, it is necessary to optimize the materials on the transformer to get the lowest losses. The study is conducted by measuring core losses and copper losses on the 60 MVA 150/20 kV power transformer with the specified specifications. Furthermore, the transformer materials are changed into several types and the losses calculations are done. The calculation results are compared to get the most effective material. The results show that in the calculation of core losses, the core material type with the lowest core loss value is NK E-core of 0,49 Watt/kg. While in the calculation of copper losses, the winding material type with the lowest loss value is Continuously Transposed Conductor.",

To effectively improve the pedestrian gender recognition performance, a new method, called cascading scene and viewpoint feature learning (CSVFL), is proposed in this article. The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used pedestrian attribute data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CSVFL approach outperforms multiple recently reported pedestrian gender recognition methods.",

    "abstract": "Applications related to smart cities require virtual cities in the experimental development stage. To build a virtual city that are close to a real city, a large number of various types of human models need to be created. To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape–pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining key and rich visual information under sophisticated road conditions is one of the key requirements for advanced driving assistance. In this paper, a newfangled end-to-end model is proposed for advanced driving assistance based on the fusion of infrared and visible images, termed as FusionADA. In our model, we are committed to extracting and fusing the optimal texture details and salient thermal targets from the source images. To achieve this goal, our model constitutes an adversarial framework between the generator and the discriminator. Specifically, the generator aims to generate a fused image with basic intensity information together with the optimal texture details from source images, while the discriminator aims to force the fused image to restore the salient thermal targets from the source infrared image. In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on publicly available datasets RoadScene and TNO demonstrate the superiority of our FusionADA over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

This project proposes the development of a smart city Hub which uses the dead electrical infrastructure with the purpose of offering technological services based on 5G. The Hub 5G is intended to integrate applications from different domains and industries, and at the same time, use open data sources to expose integrated services to the community where the Hub is located. The Hub provides a smart digital ecosystem for connected people, data, things, and services, a requirement for nowadays’ solutions. This initiative enables the application of technologies for society and the reinforcement of collaborative strategies between different industries and public and private sectors.",

In this sense, the diagnosis of the state of the infrastructure is important to ensure its operation, in which the power transformer is the key element. For this reason, this article presents an Asset Management methodology based on prediction and fuzzy logic to identify the condition of the transformer fleet from the National Laboratory of Smart Grids (LAB+i), considering its conditions. First, the forecasting system is presented together with the base parameters of the fuzzy logic system. Then an implementation analysis is performed with real data. This development allowed identifying the opportunity of using this system in different scenarios, with the challenges and benefits of the prediction methods in the Asset Management framework.",

    "abstract": "With the spread of the number of smart devices in the context of Smart City, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is considered as a vital principle to manage a large-scale heterogeneous network within centralized controller. To deal with cyberattacks against such networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is built to recognize and alert to the system administrator for further appropriate response. Currently, machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) has been explored and is still being developed. However, these systems give a high rate of false alert and are easily deceived by sophisticated attacks such as variants of attacks containing perturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously evaluate and improve these systems by simulating mutation of real-world network attack. Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks. The experiments are performed and evaluated through 2 criteria: Detection rate (DR) and F1 Score (F1) on the public dataset, named CICIDS2017. DIGFuPAS can be used for continuously pentesting and evaluating IDS's capability once integrated as an automated sustainability test pipeline for SDN-enabled networks.",

    "abstract": "The development of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure in the city leads to the emergence of the concept of smart city, an integrated solution to provide convenience for various applications in our daily life by understanding and analyzing the collected data from multi-sources. However, the collection of facial images collected from various IoT devices such as surveillance cameras, wearable, and mobile devices increases the risk of an individual's privacy leak. The facial recognition models augment this risk. These models retrieve facial data collected from IoT devices stored in smart city databases to get personal identity information. With extensive utilization of such IoT devices, which serve as a visual data collector, we compromise the person's identity. Therefore, to protect the privacy of image data from a database, we propose a Sensitivity Map Noise-Adding model based on generative adversarial networks to provide privacy for facial images against the malicious use of the face recognition models. The proposed models work as a black-box model that does not require any architectural information or the parameters of the target model. Additionally, the model runs at a real-time speed and the average run time for one operation is less than 12 milliseconds. The protection can be deployed for both local images and streaming videos. The data privacy protection is based on our proposed concept of the Sensitivity Maps, which summarizes the effectiveness and efficiency of adding noises on each pixel on the original image to interfere with the target model's performance. We have built a new dataset of facial images containing 102 celebrities for the proposed model to be trained and evaluated. The experimental results prove the advantage of the proposed method against protecting the identity information in facial images.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen a notable increase in air pollution that directly damages health, animals, and plants worldwide. To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction. In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen. An unsupervised adversarial loss is also employed in the network to minimize the difference between generated synthetic and original data in the training process. Experiments on real datasets indicate that the data generated by Airgen could significantly increase the prediction accuracy performed by deep learning models. The mean square error (MSE) is remarkably reduced from 0.024 to 0.015.",

The mean square error (MSE) is remarkably reduced from 0.024 to 0.015.",
    "introduction": "The past decade has seen a notable increase in air pollution that directly damages health, animals, and plants worldwide. To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction.",

    "abstract": "In the interest of our society, for example in Smart City but also in other specific backgrounds, environmental monitoring is an essential activity to measure the quality of different ecosystems. In fact, the need to obtain accurate and extended measurements in space and time has considerably become relevant. In very large environments, such as marine ones, technological solutions are required for the use of smart, automatic, and self-powered devices in order to reduce human maintenance service. This work presents a simple and innovative layout for a small self-powered floating buoy, with the aim of measuring and transmitting the detected data for visualization, storage and/or elaboration. The power supply was obtained using a cantilever harvester, based on piezoelectric patches, converting the motion of ripple waves. Such type of waves is characterized by frequencies between 1.50 Hz and 2.50 Hz with oscillation between 5.0 ° and 7.0 °. Specifically, a dedicated experimental setup was created to simulate the motion of ripple waves and to evaluate the suitability of the proposed design and the performance of the used harvester. Furthermore, a dynamic analytical model for the harvester has been defined and the uncertainty correlated to the harvested power has been evaluated. Finally, the harvested voltage and power have shown how the presented buoy behaves like a frequency transformer. Hence, although the used cantilever harvester does not work in its resonant frequency, the harvested electricity undergoes a significant increase.",

This paper absorbs the idea of game theory, considers the influence of individuals in the group, and proposes a decision behavior based dataset generation (DBDG) model of vehicles to predict future inter-regional traffic. In addition, we adopt simulation tools and generative adversarial networks to train the trajectory prediction model so that the private vehicle trajectory dataset conforming to social rules (e.g., collisionless) is generated. Finally, we construct from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives to verify dataset generation methods proposed in this paper.

    "abstract": "Making accurate traffic forecasting is of great importance in smart city-related researches. However, as the traffic features like traffic speed have a complex spatial-temporal characteristics, how to build an accurate traffic prediction model is still an open challenge. In this work, we propose TSTNet, a Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) spatial-temporal traffic prediction model. TSTNet adopts Graph Attention Network (GAT), which can learn the spatial feature aggregation, to build spatial dependency. For temporal dependency, TSTNet applies a Seq2Seq Transformer structure to establish temporal dependency. As a GAT layer’s operation only aggregate the attribute information for neighbor nodes, it does not involve any spatial positional information. Similarly, if we apply the Transformer model on sequence learning tasks, the Transformer model also does not involve any temporal positional information as it does not know the exact time slot of different inputs. To solve the above problems, TSTNet implements a spatial-temporal embedding method to obtain the spatial-temporal positional representation for each input data. We evaluate TSTNet on traffic speed prediction tasks with other baselines upon two real-world datasets, the results show that TSTNet outperforms all the baseline models.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the world is in a period of urbanization that will accelerate the processes of land-use cover and ecological change. Thus, establishing a land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) prediction and simulation model is of great significance for understanding the process of urban change and assessing its ecological impact. In previous studies, LUCC prediction models have been mainly based on cellular automata structures that calculate a future state pixel by pixel through transition rules. Because these transition rules are usually based on the global state and each pixel is calculated according to these fixed rules, the results of these methods have room for improvement in terms of generating details and heterogeneity. In this article, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based LUCC prediction model using multiscale local spatial information is proposed. The model is based on a pix2pix GAN and an attention structure that predicts future land use through multiscale local spatial information. To validate our model, Shenzhen, a region that is experiencing rapid urbanization, was chosen as the source of the experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy in both short-time interval and long-time interval scenarios. In addition, the results of the proposed method were also closest to the ground truth from the perspective of the landscape pattern.",

    "abstract": "Since the last decades, deep neural models have been pushing forward the frontiers of artificial intelligence. Applications that in the recent past were considered no more than utopian dreams, now appear to be feasible. The best example is autonomous driving. Despite the growing research aimed at implementing autonomous driving, no artificial intelligence can claim to have reached or closely approached the driving performance of humans, yet. While the early forms of artificial neural networks were aimed at simulating and understanding human cognition, contemporary deep neural networks are totally indifferent to cognitive studies, they are designed with pure engineering goals in mind. Several scholars, we included, argue that it urges to reconnect artificial modeling with an updated knowledge of how complex tasks are realized by the human mind and brain. In this paper, we will first try to distill concepts within neuroscience and cognitive science relevant for the driving behavior. Then, we will identify possible algorithmic counterparts of such concepts, and finally build an artificial neural model exploiting these components for the visual perception task of an autonomous vehicle. More specifically, we will point to four neurocognitive theories: the simulation theory of cognition; the Convergence–divergence Zones hypothesis; the transformational abstraction hypothesis; the free–energy predictive theory. Our proposed model tries to combine a number of existing algorithms that most closely resonate with the assumptions of these four neurocognitive theories.",

    "abstract": "Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is having a significant impact in a wide range of applications in smart city, smart home, and personal healthcare. Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.",

This model uses BERT to fine-tuning character embedding through contextual information, the problem of polysemy is solved and the performance of entity recognition of Chinese tea text is improved. In addition, the model uses last character matching algorithm, the problem of overlapping relations is solved and the accuracy of relation extraction of Chinese tea text is improved.The experimental results show that BERT-LCM-Tea F1 score to 86.8% in entity recognition task and F1score to 77.1% in relation extraction task, which is higher than the currently popular Bi-RNN-CRF, Bi-LSTM-CRF and Bi-GRU-CRF. Thus, the BERT-LCM-Tea is more suitable for the entity recognition and relation extraction of Chinese tea text, and provides a basis for future research on the construction of tea knowledge graph.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution is becoming a rising and serious environmental problem, especially in urban areas affected by an increasing migration rate. The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems’ potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output—future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution—which is an inherently much more difficult problem.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the automation of data collection and processing functions but exposes a huge amount of data to the cyberattacks risk. To tackle this issue, anomaly detection allows to identify data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset's normal behaviour indicating eventual critical incidents. In this paper, we focus on the imbalance data and the minority classes problem where the number of abnormal samples is much less than normal (secure) samples. In particular, this paper presents a new equilibrium model based on a Genetic Algorithm to improve Generative Adversarial networks (GANs). This model addresses the problem of class imbalance to anomaly detection system performance. The proposed approach use is illustrated by a case study: An intelligent transport system-based scenario.",

    "abstract": "The latest research on smart city technologies mainly focuses on utilizing cities’ resources to improve the quality of the lives of citizens. Diverse kinds of control signals from massive systems and devices such as adaptive traffic light systems in smart cities can be collected and utilized. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect a massive dataset of control signals as doing so in the real-world requires significant effort and time. This paper proposes a deep generative model which integrates a long short-term memory model with generative adversarial network (LSTM-GAN) to generate agent control signals based on the words extracted from newspaper articles to solve the problem of collecting massive signals. The discriminatory network in the LSTM-GAN takes continuous word embedding vectors as inputs generated by a pre-trained Word2Vec model. The agent control signals of sequential actions are simultaneously predicted by the LSTM-GAN in real time. Specifically, to collect the training data of smart city simulations, the LSTM-GAN is trained based on the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) newspaper dataset, which contains 5,317,731 sentences, for a total of 93,626,203 word tokens, from written texts. To verify the proposed method, agent control signals were generated and validated. In the training of the LSTM-GAN, the accuracy of the discriminator converged to 50%. In addition, the losses of the discriminator and the generator converged from 4527.04 and 4527.94 to 2.97 and 1.87, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to intelligently extract buildings from remote sensing images is of great significance for digital city construction, disaster detection and land management. The color difference between multi-temporal remote sensing images will lead to the decrease of generalization ability of building semantic segmentation model. In view of this, this paper proposes the attention-guided color consistency adversarial network (ACGAN). The algorithm takes the reference color style images and the images to be corrected in the same area and different phases as the training set and adopts the consistency adversarial network with the U-shaped attention mechanism to train the color consistency model. In the prediction stage, this model converts the hue of the images to that of the reference color style image, which is based on the reasoning ability of the deep learning model, instead of the corresponding reference color style image. This model transforms the hue of the images to be corrected into that of the reference color style images. This stage is based on the reasoning ability of the deep learning model, and the corresponding reference color style image is no longer needed. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, firstly, we compare the algorithm of this paper with the traditional image processing algorithm and other consistency adversarial network. The results show that the images after ACGAN color consistency processing are more similar to that of the reference color style images. Secondly, we carried out the building semantic segmentation experiment on the images processed by the above different color consistency algorithms, which proved that the method in this paper is more conducive to the impro-vement of the generalization ability of multi-temporal remote sensing image semantic segmentation model.",

As such, object detection has a variety of exciting downstream applications such as self-driving cars, checkout-less shopping, smart cities, cancer detection, and more. This field has been revolutionized by deep learning over the past five years, where during this time, two-stage approaches to object detection have given way to simpler, more efficient, one-stage models. Mean average precision (mAP) on benchmark problems such as the COCO Object Detection dataset has improved almost 4X over the course of five years from 15% (Fast RCNN, a two-stage approach) to 55% (EfficientDet7x, a one-stage approach). This tutorial looks under the hood of state-of-the-art object detection systems, such as two-stage, one-stage, and also more recent approaches based upon transformers. It builds out some of their associated detection pipelines in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow.

In this paper, we investigate unsupervised anomaly detection on multidimensional time series data in IoT systems, and develops a GRU-based Gaussian Mixture VAE scheme, called GGM-VAE. In particular, we employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to discover the correlations among time series data, and use Gaussian Mixture priors in the latent space to characterize the multimodal data. Several previous works assume simple distributions for Gaussian Mixture priors, resulting in insufficient ability to fully capture the data patterns. To overcome this issue, we design a model selection mechanism during the training process under the guidance of Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) to find the model which can well estimate the distribution in the Gaussian Mixture latent space. We conduct extensive simulations on four datasets and observe that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection schemes and achieves up to 47.88% improvement in F1 scores on average.",

The study of location semantics has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields due to its wide applications such as location retrieval, location recommendation, data preprocessing and so on. Established inference approaches tend to manually discover the spatiotemporal pattern of unique location as features for training classifiers. However, extracting valuable spatiotemporal patterns or features is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel location semantic inference with graph convolutional networks (SI-GCN). We introduce node2vec and variational autoencoder to learn spatial and temporal features of location, respectively. Furthermore, we leverage graph convolutional networks to capture high order relations in user's check-in activity with building a user-location bipartite network. And leveraging self-attention mechanism is allowed to distinguish contributions of the different nodes. Extensive experiments on several real-world check-in data sets show that our proposed framework outperforms than three state-of-art algorithms.",

The objective of this study is to present real-time electricity theft detection and prevention scheme (ETDPS) with the available infrastructure in the field. The proposed ETDPS is based on programmable logic control; it identifies the pilferage locations and estimates the power stolen by illegal consumers. The prototype is tested in the laboratory and the results demonstrate that the ETDPS works satisfactorily under diversified operating conditions.

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting has recently attracted increasing interest due to the popularity of online navigation services, ridesharing and smart city projects. Owing to the non-stationary nature of road traffic, forecasting accuracy is fundamentally limited by the lack of contextual information. To address this issue, we propose the Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (H-STGCN), which is able to \"deduce\" future travel time by exploiting the data of upcoming traffic volume. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to acquire the upcoming traffic volume from an online navigation engine. Taking advantage of the piecewise-linear flow-density relationship, a novel transformer structure converts the upcoming volume into its equivalent in travel time. We combine this signal with the commonly-utilized travel-time signal, and then apply graph convolution to capture the spatial dependency. Particularly, we construct a compound adjacency matrix which reflects the innate traffic proximity. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The results show that H-STGCN remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various metrics, especially for the prediction of non-recurring congestion.",

Micro-grids equipped with PV panels, wind turbines and batteries are known as hybrid power systems. Since these systems are a promising solution to build the future smart city, different designs were proposed and implemented. The present study compares two micro-grid-connected PMSG designs, with PV panels and batteries, based on system performance and power quality. In the first design, the wind turbine is connected to the common DC bus through a rectifier, while in the second configuration, it is connected to the 3-phase AC circuit via a transformer. The comparison is carried-out under different weather and system conditions. According to simulation results, the first design is less affected by voltage harmonics and has a better power quality, while the second design is robust to inverter or transformer failures and supports more loads.",

    "abstract": "The concept of smart city strives for greener technology to reduce carbon emission to ameliorate the global warming. Following this footprint, the transportation sector is experiencing a paradigm shift and the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has prodigious plausibility in reducing carbon emission. However, the anticipated EV penetration is hindered by several challenges, among them are their shorter driving range, slower charging rate and the lack of ubiquitous availability of charging locations, which collectively contribute to range anxieties for EVs' drivers. Meanwhile, the expected immense EV load onto the power distribution network may degrade the voltage stability. To reduce the range anxiety, we present a two-stage solution to provision and dimension a DC fast charging station (CS) network for the anticipated energy demand and that minimizes the deployment cost while ensuring a certain quality of experience for charging e.g., acceptable waiting time and shorter travel distance to charge. This solution also maintains the voltage stability by considering the distribution grid capacity, determining transformers' rating to support peak demand of EV charging and adding a minimum number of voltage regulators based on the impact over the power distribution network. We propose, evaluate and compare two CS network expansion models to determine a cost-effective and adaptive CSs provisioning solution that can efficiently expand the CS network to accommodate future EV charging and conventional load demands. We also propose two heuristic methods and compare our solution with them. Finally, a custom built Python-based discrete event simulator is developed to test our outcomes.",

Additionally, the penetration of the EV will increase once the users can have enough charging stations. In this work, we tackle the problem of locating a set of charging stations in a smart city considering heterogeneous data sources such as open data city portals, geo-located social network data, and energy transformer substations. We use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the charging station locations by maximizing the utility and minimizing the cost. Our proposal is validated through a case study and several experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow analysis, prediction and management are keystones for building smart cities in the new era. With the help of deep neural networks and big traffic data, we can better understand the latent patterns hidden in the complex transportation networks. The dynamic of the traffic flow on one road not only depends on the sequential patterns in the temporal dimension but also relies on other roads in the spatial dimension. Although there are existing works on predicting the future traffic flow, the majority of them have certain limitations on modeling spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial temporal graph neural network for traffic flow prediction, which can comprehensively capture spatial and temporal patterns. In particular, the framework offers a learnable positional attention mechanism to effectively aggregate information from adjacent roads. Meanwhile, it provides a sequential component to model the traffic flow dynamics which can exploit both local and global temporal dependencies. Experimental results on various real traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Urban data is a imperative resource for urban computing, which can promote the establishment of urban knowledge, the collection of urban information and the construction of smart cities. Seen that the urban data collected through hardware sensors and crowdsourcing has the limitations of uneven information distribution, poor data comprehensiveness and high resource costs, we turn to the Internet resources of real-time updates and extensive information coverage. Therefore, we propose an approach to Sensing Urban text Data from Internet Resources (SUDIR). We put forward innovative work on two key issues: Urban data recognition for Chinese context and urban data sensing for multi-source web resources. On one hand, we design a Chinese urban data recognition model based on Whole Word Masking for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT-WWM) embedding model and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory with a Conditional Random Field (BLSTM-CRF) sequence labeling model. We introduce Chinese Word Segmentaion (CWS) concept in BERT embedding model to make the text embedding effect better represent semantic information on Chinese context. BLSTM-CRF model based on deep learning is used to achieve high-quality coding and prediction. On the other hand, we propose a method of Extracting Urban text data based on Web page features and Clustering operation (EUWC). EUWC is used to correct the false negative samples labeled by BERT-WWM+BLSTM-CRF recognition model and enable SUDIR to sense more accurate and comprehensive city data from multi-source web resources. The experimental results show that our work outperforms the other baseline methods, and it also proves that SUDIR using Internet resources and deep learning technology has the advantages of low-cost, high-quality urban data sensing.",

    "abstract": "Predicting urban traffic is of great importance to smart city systems and public security; however, it is a very challenging task because of several dynamic and complex factors, such as patterns of urban geographical location, weather, seasons, and holidays. To tackle these challenges, we are stimulated by the deep-learning method proposed to unlock the power of knowledge from urban computing and proposed a deep-learning model based on neural network, entitled Capsules TCN Network, to predict the traffic flow in local areas of the city at once. Capsules TCN Network employs a Capsules Network and Temporal Convolutional Network as the basic unit to learn the spatial dependence, time dependence, and external factors of traffic flow prediction. In specific, we consider some particular scenarios that require accurate traffic flow prediction (e.g., smart transportation, business circle analysis, and traffic flow assessment) and propose a GAN-based superresolution reconstruction model. Extensive experiments were conducted based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of Capsules TCN Network beyond several state-of-the-art methods. Compared with HA, ARIMA, RNN, and LSTM classic methods, respectively, the method proposed in the paper achieved better results in the experimental verification.",

    "introduction": "Predicting urban traffic is of great importance to smart city systems and public security; however, it is a very challenging task because of several dynamic and complex factors, such as patterns of urban geographical location, weather, seasons, and holidays. To tackle these challenges, we are stimulated by the deep-learning method proposed to unlock the power of knowledge from urban computing and proposed a deep-learning model based on neural network, entitled Capsules TCN Network, to predict the traffic flow in local areas of the city at once. Capsules TCN Network employs a Capsules Network and Temporal Convolutional Network as the basic unit to learn the spatial dependence, time dependence, and external factors of traffic flow prediction. In specific, we consider some particular scenarios that require accurate traffic flow prediction (e.g., smart transportation, business circle analysis, and traffic flow assessment) and propose a GAN-based superresolution reconstruction model. Extensive experiments were conducted based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of Capsules TCN Network beyond several state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The grid denotes the electric grid which consists of communication lines, control stations, transformers, and distributors that aids in supplying power from the electrical plant to the consumers.

In this regard, a smart grid with intelligent systems is being deployed to cater the dynamic power requirements. A smart grid system follows the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) model, in which Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is integrated with physical systems.

    "abstract": "Electrification of the transportation sector can play a vital role in reshaping smart cities. With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively. It is also realized that the integration of PV improves voltage profile and reduces the negative impact of EV load. Our optimization model can work for commercial areas such as offices, university campuses, and industries as well as residential colonies.",

In order to solve this problem, this paper uses STM32F103C8T6 single chip microcomputer as the main control chip to design an intelligent socket system which can measure the power consumption, and display the power consumption information locally, and control the wireless communication with the mobile phone through GSM. The intelligent socket system adopts low power supply, and the collection of power consumption is completed by current transformer ZMCT103C. The communication mode of the system is GSM communication, and the user can plug in the intelligent plug through the mobile phone APP at any place. The system sends text messages to control on-off and timing, so as to achieve the need to save electricity. In this paper, the system software is designed, and the mainstream diagram of the system and the flow chart of the main control modules are given. Finally, the measurement and actual power consumption data of the system are given, and the physical diagram of the system is given. After various tests, the system has the advantages of high reliability and strong measurement and control function, and can be widely used in smart home control system.",

    "abstract": "The Indian government has set an ambitious goal of having an all-electric vehicle fleet by 2030. However, limiting factors related to technology, market and policy could impede their adoption. The objective of this research is to forecast how the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) will happen in India and the crucial elements that would influence adoption. The research outcomes are expected to help policy makers to optimally phase investments and incentives earmarked for public charging infrastructure. ‘Bass diffusion model’ has been used as the base for preparing a system dynamics model using Vensim software to forecast the diffusion of EV’s from 2017 to 2030. Consumer willingness to purchase EV’s has been elicited through a survey conducted among 50 respondents, who drive 4-wheelers. Adoption has been modeled considering the effect of 4 parameters on consumer willingness to purchase EV, namely- price differential between EV’s and ICE vehicles, range, recharge time and charging infrastructure density. The model output indicates an S-shaped diffusion curve with saturation near the 50th month. Out of the four parameters, adoption is found to be highly sensitive to charging infrastructure density. The paper concludes that there is a high scope of optimizing government investment in charging infrastructure which would require a detailed view of technical, policy and market related aspects.",

    "abstract": "Power Transformers (PT) are one of the most critical components of a Transmission & Distribution (T & D) Utility in terms of its impact on network availability. Apart from criticality, it is one of the costliest equipment in a substation comprising up to 60% of total investment. Multiple operational and environmental factors such as overloading, moisture, heat, progressive ageing, and so on lead to deterioration of insulation (winding and bushing), oil quality and so on result in decreasing PT operational efficiency and lifespan. It is crucial to assess the health condition of such PTs continuously to realize improved efficiency, early fault detection & diagnostics, prediction of maintenance requirements, and reinvestment strategy. The solution is developed to monitor and predict the performance of PT. Data Historian/Cloud Platform acts as a data lake and model repository to fetch online parameters and offline test results integrating with multiple data sources such as SCADA, online Dissolved Gas Analyzer device, Bushing monitor and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Asset Health Index (AHI) for PT is calculated using a multi-criteria analysis approach to derive a quantifiable figure which represents the condition based health of the PT. AHI calculation not only considers online parameters such as DGA, Load, Bushing tan delta capacitance, but also the offline test results such as power factor, Degree of Polymerization, Polarization Index, Winding Resistance and so on. Duval Triangle and IEC Ratio techniques employed in the solution for detecting the incipient fault and diagnosing nature (thermal/electrical) and location (paper/oil) of fault when it occurs. The deployed solution can help the Utilities in: (1) Adopting condition based maintenance strategy moving away from schedule based maintenance; (2) preventing unwanted breakdowns; and (3) Prioritize planning to achieve optimal balance between maintenance and replacement strategy. This paper discusses about the challenges faced by the Utilities in managing the PTs, which has crossed significant life span and the solution to resolve the challenges, taking into consideration maintenance practice followed in Utilities, availability of measurement/test data in Utilities and recommendations of international standards.",

    "introduction": "Power Transformers (PT) are one of the most critical components of a Transmission & Distribution (T & D) Utility in terms of its impact on network availability. Apart from criticality, it is one of the costliest equipment in a substation comprising up to 60% of total investment. Multiple operational and environmental factors such as overloading, moisture, heat, progressive ageing, and so on lead to deterioration of insulation (winding and bushing), oil quality and so on result in decreasing PT operational efficiency and lifespan. It is crucial to assess the health condition of such PTs continuously to realize improved efficiency, early fault detection & diagnostics, prediction of maintenance requirements, and reinvestment strategy. The solution is developed to monitor and predict the performance of PT. Data Historian/Cloud Platform acts as a data lake and model repository to fetch online parameters and offline test results integrating with multiple data sources such as SCADA, online Dissolved Gas Analyzer device, Bushing monitor and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Asset Health Index (AHI) for PT is calculated using a multi-criteria analysis approach to derive a quantifiable figure which represents the condition based health of the PT. AHI calculation not only considers online parameters such as DGA, Load, Bushing tan delta capacitance, but also the offline test results such as power factor, Degree of Polymerization, Polarization Index, Winding Resistance and so on. Duval Triangle and IEC Ratio techniques employed in the solution for detecting the incipient fault and diagnosing nature (thermal/electrical) and location (paper/oil) of fault when it occurs. The deployed solution can help the Utilities in: (1) Adopting condition based maintenance strategy moving away from schedule based maintenance; (2) preventing unwanted breakdowns; and (3) Prioritize planning to achieve optimal balance between maintenance and replacement strategy.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been promising for many computer vision problems due to their powerful capabilities to enhance the data for training and test. In this paper, we leveraged GANs and proposed a new architecture with a cascaded Single Shot Detector (SSD) for pedestrian detection at distance, which is yet a challenge due to the varied sizes of pedestrians in videos at distance. To overcome the low-resolution issues in pedestrian detection at distance, DCGAN is employed to improve the resolution first to reconstruct more discriminative features for a SSD to detect objects in images or videos. A crucial advantage of our method is that it learns a multi-scale metric to distinguish multiple objects at different distances under one image, while DCGAN serves as an encoder-decoder platform to generate parts of an image that contain better discriminative information. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) dataset, and it was demonstrated that the proposed new architecture achieved a much better detection rate, particularly on vehicles and pedestrians at distance, making it highly suitable for smart cities applications that need to discover key objects or pedestrians at distance.",

This paper aims to discover a mapping between live and dead phytoplankton. We propose PhytoGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network for the unpaired dead-tolive phytoplankton translation. We design a new PCALoss by extracting the principal component of the image to enhance the contour of the generated image. The addition of PCALoss can significantly improve the integrity of images. The experiments are carried out on the existing phytoplankton dataset. A series of experiments are discussed in the paper to demonstrate the performance of the domain transformation and the proposed loss functions. The experimental results indicate that PhytoGAN can produce more integral images of phytoplankton while completing the domain transformation compared with the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Since the rate at which new content is uploaded to the Internet has reached unprecedented marks, knowing the popularity of online content, especially video, is of importance for network management, recommendation schemes, service design, advertising planning, and so on. Despite the fact that various models have been developed, few of them address the short-term popularity prediction. Toward this goal, we exploit the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer, a state-of-the-art model in neural machine translation, to forecast the values of multiple time series in the near future. Specifically, we propose an attention-based non-recursive neural network, a novel model that entirely dispenses with recurrence and convolutions, for time series prediction. Since our model is the combination of the input attention mechanism in the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) and the self-attention of Transformer, it is able to adaptively select the most relevant input sequences as well as capture the long-term dependencies across previous time steps to make the prediction. The experiments show the root mean square errors (RMSEs) achieved by our model are only 6.06 and 3.60 when testing on the NASDAQ 100 dataset and the views count of the top most popular videos on Youtube respectively, while the RMSEs of DA-RNN are 8.52 and 12.31. Hence, our model outperforms the baseline not only in time series prediction but also in contents popularity prediction aspect.",

These communication technologies are going through sharp modernization to meet future demand growth and to achieve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid. In this paper, we implement an IPv6 based two-way communication system between the transformer agent (TA), installed at local electric transformer and various customer agents (CAs), connected to customer's smart meter. Various homes share their energy usage with the TA which in turn sends the utility's recommendations to the CAs. Raspberry Pi is used as hardware for all the CAs and the TA. We implement a self-healing mesh network between all nodes using OpenLab IEEE 802.15.4 chips and Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and the data is secured by RSA/AES keys. Several tests have been conducted in real environments, inside and outside of Carleton University, to test the performance of this communication network in various obstacle settings. In this paper, we highlight the details behind the implementation of this IPv6-based smart grid communication system, the related challenges, and the proposed solutions.",

However, depth maps are usually captured in a lower resolution as compared to RGB color images due to the inherent limitations of the sensors. Naively increasing its resolution often leads to loss of sharpness and incorrect estimates, especially in the regions with depth discontinuities or depth boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework for depth map super-resolution that is able to preserve the smooth areas, as well as the sharp edges at the boundaries of the depth map. Our proposed model is trained on two different modalities, namely color images and depth maps. However, at test time, our model only requires the depth map in order to produce a higher resolution version. We evaluated our model both quantitatively and qualitatively, and our experiments show that our method performs better than existing state-of-the-art models.",

However, not all applications have the luxury of using depth sensors or multiple cameras to obtain depth information. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the per-pixel depths from a single image. Inspired by the recent works on generative neural network models, we formulate the task of depth estimation as a generative task where we synthesize an image of the depth map from a single Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) input image. We propose a novel generative adversarial network that has an encoder-decoder type generator with residual transposed convolution blocks trained with an adversarial loss. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several depth estimation works.",
