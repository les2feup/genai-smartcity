Therefore, it is crucial to generate pseudo personal mobility data that accurately reflects real-world mobility patterns while safeguarding user privacy. Nevertheless, existing methods for generating pseudo mobility data, mostly focusing on trip or trajectory generation, have limitations in capturing sufficient individual heterogeneity. To address these gaps, taking pseudo-person(avatar) as ground-zero, a novel individual-based human mobility generator named GeoAvatar has been proposed \u2013 which considering individual heterogeneity in spatial and temporal decision-making, incorporates demographic characteristics. Our method utilizes a deep generative model to generate heterogeneous individual life patterns, a variation inference model for inferring individual demographic characteristics, and a Bayesian-based approach for generating spatial choices considering individual demographic characteristics. Through our method, we have achieved generating realistic pseudo personal human mobility data - we evaluated the proposed method based on physical features \u2013 obeying common law of human mobility, activity features \u2013 showing diverse and realistic activities, and spatial-temporal characteristics \u2013 presenting high-accuracy in terms of temporal grid population and od-count, demonstrating its good performance, with both a big mobile phone GPS trajectory dataset from Tokyo Metropolis and a big mobile phone CDR dataset from Shanghai. Furthermore, this method maintains extensibility for broader applications, making it a promising framework for generating pseudo personal human mobility data.",

However, existing models face significant challenges in processing intricate building structures: Transformer-based models suffer from high computational complexity and memory demands, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often struggle to capture features across multiple scales and hierarchical levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture, Mamba-in-Mamba U-Net (MiM-UNet), which integrates the design principles of state\u2013space models (SSMs) to enhance both computational efficiency and feature extraction capacity. Specifically, MiM-UNet refines the traditional encoder\u2013decoder framework by introducing Mamba-in-Mamba blocks, enabling precise multi-scale feature capture and efficient information fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MiM-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in segmentation accuracy on the Massachusetts building dataset, while substantially reducing computational overhead, highlighting its superior performance and promising potential for practical applications.",

The objective of this study is to propose a transformer-based UNet-like framework for end-to-end building change detection, integrating multi-temporal and multi-source data to improve efficiency and accuracy. Unlike conventional methods that focus on either spectral imagery or digital surface models (DSMs), the proposed method combines RGB color imagery, DSMs, and building vector maps in a three-branch Siamese architecture to enhance spatial, spectral, and elevation-based feature extraction. We chose Hsinchu, Taiwan as the experimental site and used 1:1000 digital topographic maps and airborne imagery from 2017, 2020, and 2023. The experimental results demonstrated that the data fusion model significantly outperforms other data combinations, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in detecting building changes. The RGB images provide spectral and texture details, DSMs offer structural and elevation context, and the building vector map enhances semantic consistency. This research advances building change detection by introducing a fully transformer-based model for end-to-end change detection, incorporating diverse geospatial data sources, and improving accuracy over traditional CNN-based methods. The proposed framework offers a scalable and automated solution for modern mapping workflows, contributing to more efficient geospatial data updating and urban monitoring.",

        "abstract":"Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies\u2014such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks\u2014to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows\u2014namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity\u2014critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

So far, no reliable models have been developed for intersections that effectively account for the variation in crash types and the cyclical nature of Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) and traffic flow. Moreover, the limited research available has primarily relied on sampling techniques to address data imbalance, without exploring alternative solutions. We develop an anomaly detection framework by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to predict the likelihood of cycle-level crashes at intersections. The model is built using high-resolution event data extracted from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM), including SPaT and traffic flow insights from 11 intersections in Seminole County, Florida. Our framework demonstrates a sensitivity of 76% in predicting crash events using highly imbalanced crash data along with real-world SPaT and traffic data, highlighting its potential for deployment at smart intersections. Overall, the results provide a roadmap for city-wide implementation at smart intersections, with the potential for multiple real-time solutions for impending crashes. These include adjustments in signal timing, driver warnings using various means, and more efficient emergency response, all with major implications for creating more livable and safe cities.",

This paper develops an innovative approach that integrates Edge Implicit Weighting and Aggregated Graph Transformer architecture for accurate and timely intrusion detection.

The performance of the proposed detection technique is analyzed using multiple datasets with standard evaluation parameters.

The majority of humans live their lives in urban environments, using detailed virtual models for applications as diverse as virtual worlds, special effects, and urban planning. Generating such 3D models from exemplars manually is time-consuming, while 3D deep learning approaches have high memory costs. In this paper, we present a technique for training 2D neural networks to repeatedly sculpt a plane into a large-scale 3D urban environment. An initial coarse depth map is created by a GAN model, from which we refine 3D normal and depth using an image translation network regularized by a linear system. The networks are trained using real-world data to allow generative synthesis of meshes at scale. We exploit sculpting from multiple viewpoints to generate a highly detailed, concave, and water-tight 3D mesh. We show cityscapes at scales of 100\u00d71600 meters with more than 2 million triangles, and demonstrate that our results are objectively and subjectively similar to our exemplars.",

Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs.",

In the developed AI agent-based intelligent digital twin (I-DT), UBEM overcomes the limitations of the traditional UBEM approach and enables efficient analysis of urban building energy. GPT-based UBEM effectively performed the core functions of UBEM, serving as a key technology in I-UDT applications and services. What are the implications of the main findings? The I-UDT enables more accurate and comprehensive urban energy management, supporting the development of sustainable cities and carbon-neutral strategies. Implementing I-UDTs enables urban policymakers to make data-driven decisions, improve energy efficiency, and enhance the scalability of digital twin applications. The concept of digital twins (DTs) has expanded to encompass buildings and cities, with urban building energy modeling (UBEM) playing a crucial role in predicting urban-scale energy consumption via modeling individual energy use and interactions. As a virtual model within urban digital twins (UDTs), UBEM offers the potential for managing energy in sustainable cities. However, UDTs face challenges with regard to integrating large-scale data and relying on bottom-up UBEM approaches. In this study, we propose an AI agent-based intelligent urban digital twin (I-UDT) to enhance DTs\u2019 technical realization and UBEM\u2019s service functionality. Integrating GPT within the UDT enabled the efficient integration of fragmented city-scale data and the extraction of building features, addressing the limitations of the service realization of traditional UBEM. This framework ensures continuous updates of the virtual urban model and the streamlined provision of updated information to users in future studies. This research establishes the concept of an I-UDT and lays a foundation for future implementations. The case studies include (1) data analysis, (2) prediction, (3) feature engineering, and (4) information services for 3500 buildings in Seoul. Through these case studies, the I-UDT was integrated and analyzed scattered data, predicted energy consumption, derived conditioned areas, and evaluated buildings on benchmark.",

        "abstract":"Highlights: What are the main findings? For smart city management, LLM-based multi-agent systems achieve 94\u201399% accuracy in routing urban queries and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality (G-Eval scores of 0.68\u20130.74) compared to standalone LLMs (0.30\u20130.38). Achievement of high scores in routing queries and response accuracy is possible with middle-size LLM models rather than the biggest LLM models. What is the implication of the main findings? The multi-agent LLM approach enables efficient processing of complex urban planning tasks while maintaining high relevance in responses, making it practical for real-world city management applications. LLM agents can effectively augment human decision making in urban planning by reducing task completion time from days to hours while maintaining accuracy and accountability in complex scenarios. This study investigates the implementation of LLM agents in smart city management, leveraging both the inherent language processing abilities of LLMs and the distributed problem solving capabilities of multi-agent systems for the improvement of urban decision making processes. A multi-agent system architecture combines LLMs with existing urban information systems to process complex queries and generate contextually relevant responses for urban planning and management. The research is focused on three main hypotheses testing: (1) LLM agents\u2019 capability for effective routing and processing diverse urban queries, (2) the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology in improving response accuracy when working with local knowledge and regulations, and (3) the impact of integrating LLM agents with existing urban information systems. Our experimental results, based on a comprehensive validation dataset of 150 question\u2013answer pairs, demonstrate significant improvements in decision support capabilities. The multi-agent system achieved pipeline selection accuracy of 94\u201399% across different models, while the integration of RAG technology improved response accuracy by 17% for strategic development queries and 55% for service accessibility questions. The combined use of document databases and service APIs resulted in the highest performance metrics (G-Eval scores of 0.68\u20130.74) compared to standalone LLM responses (0.30\u20130.38). Using St. Petersburg\u2019s Digital Urban Platform as a testbed, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach to create integrated city management systems with support complex urban decision making processes. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced urban management by providing empirical evidence of LLM agents\u2019 effectiveness in processing heterogeneous urban data and supporting strategic planning decisions. Our findings suggest that LLM-based multi-agent systems can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of urban decision making while maintaining high relevance in responses.",

However, this expansion has been paralleled by a corresponding increase in the sophistication and variety of cyber threats targeting these networks. Traditional cyber security measures, designed for a less dynamic threat landscape, are proving increasingly insufficient in protecting against the innovative and varied attack methods now in commonplace. This study introduces an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address this challenge, presenting a novel framework for the simulation and mitigation of advanced network attacks, particularly focusing on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and spoofing attacks which pose significant threats in IoT environments. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), comprising two neural networks-the generator and the discriminator compete in a game-theoretic scenario, facilitating a deep understanding of attack patterns through the generation of realistic, synthetic cyber-attack scenarios. This research exploits GANs to bridge the gap between the static nature of traditional security protocols and the dynamic, evolving landscape of cyber threats. By training on a comprehensive dataset of known attacks and normal network activities, our proposed model, the Dynamic Adaptive Threat Simulation GAN (DATS-GAN), is capable of producing varied and realistic attack scenarios. These simulations serve a dual purpose: they not only enhance the detection capabilities and responsiveness of current security systems but also provide a basis for the development of new, adaptive security mechanisms capable of dynamically responding to the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. The effectiveness of DATS-GAN is demonstrated through extensive empirical analysis, highlighting significant improvements in the detection precision and reaction times of security frameworks within WSNs. Moreover, the generated synthetic attack scenarios provide a valuable resource for training machine learning models, leading to the advancement of adaptive security solutions that maintain a high readiness level against emerging cyber threats. The outcomes of this research hold substantial promise for the cyber security domain, showcasing the potential of GANs to revolutionize network defenses against sophisticated cyber threats in IoT and WSN environments.",

Generative AI and LLM integration prove influential in optimizing EV functionalities, enhancing security, and fortifying data privacy. This chapter delves into battery technology, battery capacities, energy storage, charging infrastructure optimization, autonomous driving, educational outreach, energy management, and predictive maintenance. In particular, LLMs address EV challenges by optimizing routes, speeds, and behaviors, reducing energy usage and emissions. They facilitate the smart integration of EVs and renewable energy sources, managing charging schedules based on availability and grid demands. Additionally, LLMs contribute to public education on EV benefits, environmental impact, cost savings, and sustainable transportation promotion. The chapter explores synergies between LLMs and EVs, focusing on potential applications and challenges, propelling progress in ITSs. Similarly, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and their potential applications in the era of the EV represent a promising frontier in this landscape, offering enhanced capabilities to interpret and generate multimodal data, further enriching the EV ecosystem.",

Governments across the world are increasingly promoting the construction of smart cities and intelligent security systems to safeguard the lives and property of citizens and maintain social stability. Person re-identification (ReID) is an essential technology for building smart cities, with significant implications for security monitoring and criminal investigation applications. The goal of person re-identification is to accurately identify specific individuals captured under different cameras. However, due to intra-class differences resulting from various factors such as illumination, viewpoint, occlusion, and pose, person re-identification remains a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Although existing fully supervised person re-identification methods have made significant progress, the scarcity of data and labels poses a bottleneck for further improving model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce a more complex and diverse synthetic dataset with easy-to-obtain labels for auxiliary training, and propose a novel camera-aware asymmetric adversarial learning (CAAL) method that overcomes intra-class variation among multiple cameras and the domain-shift between real data and synthetic data, enabling the learning of camera-invariant feature representations from diverse data sources. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of misleading information carried by synthetic datasets and prevent the model from overfitting to synthetic data during adversarial training, we propose using an auxiliary network trained on real-world data to constrain the training of the backbone network. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

While generative models and image classification have greatly benefited from diffusion models, the present ones primarily concentrate on single-modality-driven diffusion processes. Therefore, this paper presents a 3D self-awareness diffusion network (3DSA-DiffNet) for multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) image fusion classification, which would make it easier to classify heterogeneous data from various sensors. First, in order to model the relationship between multi-channel spectra and multi-pixel spatial distributions as well as samples, respectively, a spatial-spectral joint denoising network (S2 JD-Net) is proposed. It can incorporate the diffusion process into the neural network to enhance the quality of diffusion features. Secondly, to imitate the brain's spatial-spectral coexistence learning mechanism, this work offers a 3D self-awareness module (3DSA-Module) that can learn the weight of each pixel in 3D space, resulting in extraordinarily high feature representation capabilities. Finally, experimental verification demonstrates that the 3D self-awareness diffusion fusion network driven by brain inspiration outperforms more sophisticated approaches on the Xi'an, Huhhot, and Muufl datasets.",

In practical applications, the constraints of observation trajectories frequently lead to the acquisition of a limited dataset of sparse SAR images, presenting challenges for TomoSAR 3D Reconstruction and affecting its signal-to-noise ratio and elevation resolution performance. The study introduces a cascade adversarial strategy based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), optimised explicitly for sparse observation trajectories. In the preliminary phase of the CGAN, the U-Net architecture was employed to capture more global information and enhance image detail recovery capability, which is subsequently utilised in the cascade refinement network. The ResNet34 residual network in the advanced network stage was adopted to bolster feature extraction and image generation capabilities further. Based on experimental validation performed on the curated TomoSAR 3D super-resolution dataset tailored for buildings, the findings reveal that the methodology yields a notable enhancement in image quality and accuracy compared to other techniques.",

This paper comprehensively reviews the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in optimizing ITS. Initially, we provide an extensive overview of ITS, highlighting its components, operational principles, and overall effectiveness. We then delve into the theoretical background of various LLM techniques, such as GPT, T5, CTRL, and BERT, elucidating their relevance to ITS applications. Following this, we examine the wide-ranging applications of LLMs within ITS, including traffic flow prediction, vehicle detection and classification, autonomous driving, traffic sign recognition, and pedestrian detection. Our analysis reveals how these advanced models can significantly enhance traffic management and safety. Finally, we explore the challenges and limitations LLMs face in ITS, such as data availability, computational constraints, and ethical considerations. We also present several future research directions and potential innovations to address these challenges. This paper aims to guide researchers and practitioners through the complexities and opportunities of integrating LLMs in ITS, offering a roadmap to create more efficient, sustainable, and responsive next-generation transportation systems.",

        "abstract":"Change detection (CD) is an important research direction in the field of remote sensing, which aims to analyze the changes in the same area over different periods and is widely used in urban planning and environmental protection. While supervised learning methods in change detection have demonstrated substantial efficacy, they are often hindered by the rising costs associated with data annotation. Semi-supervised methods have attracted increasing interest, offering promising results with limited data labeling. These approaches typically employ strategies such as consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, and generative adversarial networks. However, they usually face the problems of insufficient data augmentation and unbalanced quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling. To address the above problems, we propose a semi-supervised change detection method with data augmentation and adaptive threshold updating (DA-AT) for high-resolution remote sensing images. Firstly, a channel-level data augmentation (CLDA) technique is designed to enhance the strong augmentation effect and improve consistency regularization so as to address the problem of insufficient feature representation. Secondly, an adaptive threshold (AT) is proposed to dynamically adjust the threshold during the training process to balance the quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling so as to optimize the self-training process. Finally, an adaptive class weight (ACW) mechanism is proposed to alleviate the impact of the imbalance between the changed classes and the unchanged classes, which effectively enhances the learning ability of the model for the changed classes. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on two high-resolution remote sensing image datasets, WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD. We compare our method to five state-of-the-art change detection methods and show that it achieves better or comparable results.",

        "abstract":"With the development and widespread application of network information, new technologies led by 5G are emerging, resulting in an increasingly complex network security environment and more diverse attack methods. Unlike traditional networks, 5G networks feature higher connection density, faster data transmission speeds, and lower latency, which are widely applied in scenarios such as smart cities, the Internet of Things, and autonomous driving. The vast amounts of sensitive data generated by these applications become primary targets during the processes of collection and secure sharing, and unauthorized access or tampering could lead to severe data breaches and integrity issues. However, as 5G networks extensively employ encryption technologies to protect data transmission, attackers can hide malicious content within encrypted communication, rendering traditional content-based traffic detection methods ineffective for identifying malicious encrypted traffic. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a malicious encrypted traffic detection method based on reconstructive domain adaptation and adversarial hybrid neural networks. The proposed method integrates generative adversarial networks with ResNet, ResNeXt, and DenseNet to construct an adversarial hybrid neural network, aiming to tackle the challenges of encrypted traffic detection. On this basis, a reconstructive domain adaptation module is introduced to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain, thereby enhancing cross-domain detection capabilities. By preprocessing traffic data from public datasets, the proposed method is capable of extracting deep features from encrypted traffic without the need for decryption. The generator utilizes the adversarial hybrid neural network module to generate realistic malicious encrypted traffic samples, while the discriminator achieves sample classification through high-dimensional feature extraction. Additionally, the domain classifier within the reconstructive domain adaptation module further improves the model\u2019s stability and generalization across different network environments and time periods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of malicious encrypted traffic detection in 5G network environments, effectively enhancing the detection performance of malicious traffic in 5G networks.",

        "abstract":"The study proposes an innovative approach to enhance energy efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for smart city applications. The primary focus is on leveraging distributed artificial intelligence (AI) and multipath routing techniques to address challenges such as unequal clustering, poor cluster head selection, and excessive power consumption within WSNs. The approach uses agent-based clustering, where autonomous AI agents dynamically form clusters of sensor nodes based on real-time data characteristics. These clusters are then used for multipath routing, optimizing energy consumption, reliability, and congestion reduction. The distributed nature of AI agents allows for adaptive cluster formations. This algorithm aims to address issues related to uneven clustering, inefficient cluster head selection, and excessive power consumption. Additionally, the integration of agent-based clustering is proposed, involving the deployment of autonomous AI agents that dynamically cluster sensor nodes based on real-time data properties. These AI agents facilitate self-organization and adaptability, ensuring that clusters accurately reflect the evolving data landscape in urban environments. The approach also employs sophisticated energy management strategies at the sensor node level, such as duty cycling, adaptive transmission power control, and sleep-wake scheduling. Simulations in a smart city environment show significant improvements in energy efficiency, prolonging the network\u2019s operational lifespan and improving service quality by mitigating data loss and latency issues. This approach contributes to the sustainable development and performance optimization of smart city infrastructure.",

However, its potential for future urban planning (UP), particularly in predicting future urban layouts remains largely unexplored. This study introduces UP-Diff, a novel method leveraging generative models for UP, to address this gap. UP-Diff leverages information from current urban layouts and planned change maps to predict future urban configurations. Key challenges addressed include the integration of urban layouts and change maps into latent diffusion model (LDM) through careful architecture improvements and the mitigation of limited training data by employing a pretrained stable diffusion (SD) model with fixed weights, trainable ConvNeXt, and trainable cross-attention layers. Our method significantly streamlines the UP process by automating layout predictions, thus reducing the time and effort required compared to traditional manual methods. Comprehensive evaluations on the learning, vision, and RS dataset (LEVIR-CD) and Sun Yat-Sen University dataset (SYSU-CD) validate that UP-Diff achieves high-fidelity predictions of future urban layouts, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for advancing RS-based UP methodologies.

Given the shifts in water supply patterns due to global climate change and ongoing urbanization, understanding and predicting how urban design affects drought is crucial for sustainable human settlements. Previous research has primarily focused on large-scale predictive modeling, making it difficult for architects and urban designers to address potential drought risks. This study addresses that issue by proposing an urban planning prediction model based on generative adversarial networks that integrates temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) maps. The model is trained on relevant datasets by using Guangzhou as a case study, including land cover, land surface temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index data. TVDI maps are generated from untrained image pairs based on urban planning parameters. Model validation, including accuracy analysis and scenario simulations, is conducted to assess the model's ability to predict urban land surface drought resulting from changes in urban planning. This approach highlights its proactive capacity to anticipate and reveal long-term or gradually unfolding drought trends, offering valid tools for urban design and planning.",

We focus on early-stage urban design, where sketching is a common tool and the design starts from balancing building volumes (masses) and open spaces. With Human-Centered AI in mind, we aim to help architects quickly revise their ideas by easily switching between 2D sketches and 3D models, allowing for smoother iteration and sharing of ideas. Inspired by feedback from architects and existing workflows, our system takes as a first input a user sketch of multiple buildings in a top-down view. The user then draws a perspective sketch of the envisioned site. Our method is designed to exploit the complementarity of information in the two sketches and allows users to quickly preview and adjust the inferred 3D shapes. Our model has two main components. First, we propose a novel sketch-to-depth prediction network for perspective sketches that exploits top-down sketch shapes. Second, we use depth cues derived from the perspective sketch as a condition to our diffusion model, which ultimately completes the geometry in a top-down view. Thus, our final 3D geometry is represented as a heightfield, allowing users to construct the city \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d. The code, datasets, and interface are available at visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk\/pubs\/groundup.",

In this study we tackle this problem by utilizing Street View Images (SVIs) and proposing a novel ensemble learning architecture that leverages building facade features and text extracted from hoardings, posters, etc. on buildings to predict the usage class. A pre-trained object detection model i.e., Grounding DINO, is implemented to efficiently identify buildings. A novel manually labeled training data of detected buildings corresponding to their usage is used to extract features from building facades across diverse Indian cities (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi) using Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Following this, CLIPSeg a pre-trained segmentation model is used to recognizes text specifically on building elements like signs, posters, and banners. We then leverage GPT-3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), fine-tuned with a specifically designed few-shot prompting method, to infer building usage from the recognized text. To achieve optimal performance, the proposed ensemble linear metaclassifier combines predictions from ViT and LLM model. The predicted building usages are attributed to their corresponding locations to develop spatial maps. An analysis of our framework compared against ground truth data collected from various Indian cities reveals significantly accurate outcomes. Our findings highlight the utility of textual information in classifying utilities and commercial buildings, while features extracted from vision models prove more informative for residential buildings. Our approach can automate the generation of roadside building attributes and usage details on a larger scale.",

Identifying pavement materials is a key factor in assessing mobility, such as walkability and wheelchair usability. However, satellite imagery in this scenario is limited, and in situ mapping can be costly. A promising solution is to extract such geospatial features from street-level imagery. This study explores using open-vocabulary classification algorithms to segment and identify pavement types and surface materials in this scenario. Our approach uses large language models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy of classifying different pavement types. The methodology involves two experiments: the first uses free prompting with random street-view images, employing Grounding Dino and SAM algorithms to assess performance across categories. The second experiment evaluates standardized pavement classification using the Deep Pavements dataset and a fine-tuned CLIP algorithm optimized for detecting OSM-compliant pavement categories. The study presents open resources, such as the Deep Pavements dataset and a fine-tuned CLIP-based model, demonstrating a significant improvement in the true positive rate (TPR) from 56.04% to 93.5%. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current open-vocabulary algorithms and emphasize the importance of diverse training datasets.

Traditional models often lack consideration of personalized features and exhibit suboptimal performance in constructing spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method that integrates spatiotemporal information with travel-related information and employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) for adversarial training. This method accurately fits the true distribution of user travel data, thereby providing detailed profiles of public transportation passengers\u2019 travel behavior. Specifically, the proposed approach considers the complete travel chain of individuals, establishes a spatiotemporal constraint representation model, and utilizes GANs to simulate the distribution of passenger travel, obtaining more compact and high-level travel vector features. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately captures passengers\u2019 travel patterns in both the temporal and spatial dimensions, offering technical support for urban transportation planning.",

This study reveals that Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled metaverse offers transformative potential for developing sustainable smart cities. AI techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, generative AI (GAI), and large language models (LLMs), enhance the metaverse\u2019s capabilities in data analysis, urban decision making, and personalised user experiences. The study further examines how these advanced AI models facilitate key metaverse technologies such as big data analytics, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, digital twins, Internet of Things (IoT), Edge AI, and 5G\/6G networks. Applications across various smart city domains\u2014environment, mobility, energy, health, governance, and economy, and real-world use cases of virtual cities like Singapore, Seoul, and Lisbon are presented, demonstrating AI\u2019s effectiveness in the metaverse for smart cities. However, AI-enabled metaverse in smart cities presents challenges related to data acquisition and management, privacy, security, interoperability, scalability, and ethical considerations. These challenges\u2019 societal and technological implications are discussed, highlighting the need for robust data governance frameworks and AI ethics guidelines. Future directions emphasise advancing AI model architectures and algorithms, enhancing privacy and security measures, promoting ethical AI practices, addressing performance measures, and fostering stakeholder collaboration. By addressing these challenges, the full potential of AI-enabled metaverse can be harnessed to enhance sustainability, adaptability, and livability in smart cities.",

This study introduces a method for predicting urban solar radiation using 2D mapping data, applying a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to the city of Boston. Traditional solar radiation simulation methods, such as 3D modeling and satellite imagery, require complex and resource-intensive data inputs.

The GAN model, using detailed 3D urban modeling and simulation results, trained paired datasets of geographic information and solar radiation heatmaps. It achieved high accuracy and resolution, with the 300 m scale model demonstrating the best performance (R2 = 0.864). The model\u2019s capability to generate high-resolution (2 m) solar radiation maps from simplified inputs demonstrates the potential of GANs for urban climate data prediction, offering a rapid and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Nevertheless, these judgments are a spatial representation not visible in reality, and with the spread of artificial intelligence models, different implementations can support the planning process, such as the use of GANs. In this case, GANs can be exploited by adopting pre-existing location images resulting from experts\u2019 judgments to illustrate the proposed intervention\u2019s visual impact.

Traditional methods for addressing UHI are often resource-intensive and slow. This study introduces a novel approach, utilizing a Hybrid CycleGAN-SVM (HCGS) model that leverages the synergy of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to efficiently analyze and mitigate UHI effects through high-resolution satellite imagery and temperature data. The model incorporates Enhanced Vision Transformers (EViTs) for superior feature extraction, adept at capturing intricate spatial and spectral urban patterns. The CycleGAN component of the model generates high-quality synthetic imagery, enhancing the dataset and addressing class imbalances, thereby bolstering the SVM classifier\u2019s ability to precisely pinpoint heat-prone urban areas. Implemented in Google Colab, the HCGS model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.98. This indicates its potential as an effective tool for urban heat mitigation, offering actionable insights for urban planning and policy-making. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with remote sensing data, the HCGS model paves the way for innovative climate adaptation strategies, fostering more sustainable and resilient urban environments.",

Direct inspections and manual annotations are costly at scale, while conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. This study explores vision language models as a tool for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation. Although these models excel at describing common objects in human-centric images, their training sets may lack signals for esoteric built environment features, making their performance uncertain. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept using a vision language model and a visual prompting strategy that considers segmented image elements. Experiments on two urban features - stop lines and raised tables - show that while zero-shot prompting rarely works, the segmentation and visual prompting strategies achieve nearly 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results motivate further research in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at scale and in diverse environments.",

Traditional OD prediction models, while effective within single cities, often face limitations when applied across different cities due to varied traffic conditions, urban layouts, and socio-economic factors. In this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art learning-based methods in cross-city OD flow prediction.",

Existing human mobility generation models often fall short of understanding travelers\u2019 demographics and integrating multimodal information, including activity purposes, destination choices and transport mode preferences. Recently, mobility generation models leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention, while they are limited in directly reproducing spatial information in human mobility profiles. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Mobility Generative Language Model (MobGLM), a novel approach for generating synthetic human mobility data to support urban planning, transport management, energy consumption and epidemic control. MobGLM addresses these limitations by capturing the complex relationships between agents\u2019 mobility patterns and individual demographics. By incorporating personal information, activity types, locations and traffic modes as encoders, MobGLM uniquely identifies and replicates features of human mobility. Our framework is evaluated using a large, real-world mobility dataset and benchmarked against state-of-the-art personal mobility generation techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of MobGLM in producing accurate and reliable synthetic mobility data, highlighting its potential applications in various urban mobility contexts.",

This paper introduces a novel model, the Spatial\u2013Temporal Similarity Fusion Graphs Adversarial Convolutional Networks (STSF-GACN), which leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques to enhance the predictive accuracy and efficiency of traffic flow forecasting. The innovation of our approach lies in the meticulous construction of the spatial\u2013temporal similarity matrix through the precise calculation of temporal and spatial similarities. This matrix forms the backbone of our model, serving as the generator in the integrated Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The Spatial\u2013Temporal Similarity Fusion Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network, developed as part of our GAN's generator, utilizes cutting-edge techniques such as the Wasserstein distance and Dynamic Time Warping to optimize the adaptive adjacency matrix, enabling the model to capture latent spatial\u2013temporal correlations with unprecedented depth and precision. The discriminator of the GAN further refines the model by evaluating the accuracy of the traffic predictions, ensuring that the generative model produces results that are not only accurate but also robust against varying traffic conditions. This cohesive integration of GAN into the model architecture allows for a significant improvement in prediction accuracy and convergence speed, moving beyond traditional forecasting methods.",

To address these issues, a method for building feature extraction based on Mask Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) is proposed. This approach combines deep learning techniques with aerial images to ensure precise and efficient automatic detection and feature extraction. Urban building images are captured through aerial photography, and building outlines are annotated to create a comprehensive dataset of building features. The Mask R-CNN-based method efficiently processes and classifies the features of the dataset, generating candidate regions for further analysis. Additionally, this method demonstrates significant advantages in building feature extraction by employing the Mask R-CNN model to generate adaptive features. Comparative analysis with models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Fast R-CNN), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) indicates that Mask R-CNN exhibits superior performance in building feature extraction. The Mask R-CNN-based approach achieved approximately 95 % classification accuracy, while also showcasing strong stability and generalization capabilities. This study provides new methodologies and insights for enhancing feature extraction in aerial building imagery, offering significant reference value for the fields of architectural design and urban planning.",

        "abstract":"This research proposes a design system that combines a case-based learning algorithm with a rule-based optimization algorithm to automatically generate and revise urban form prototypes based on historical cases and user requirements. The system aims to address the challenges of existing generative methods for urban forms, such as the lack of flexibility and organicity of rule-based methods and the insufficient manipulability and interpretability of the newest GAN-integrated case-based methods.

This approach is highly suitable for computer processing and allows for the rapid rendering of entire building models and cities, especially when the buildings are not highly diverse, thus fully leveraging the strengths of procedural modeling. The first hypothesis is that buildings in the real world are mostly different and they should still be able to be displayed through procedural modeling procedures, and the second hypothesis is that this can be achieved in several ways. The first hypothesis suggests that real-world buildings, despite their diversity, can still be effectively represented through procedural modeling. The second hypothesis explores various methods to achieve this representation. The first approach involves recognizing the basic characteristics of a building from photographs and creating a model using machine learning. The second approach utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate detailed building models based on comprehensive input data. A script is generated for each building, making reverse procedural modeling in combination with AI an intriguing field of study, which is explored in this research. To validate this method, we compare AI-generated building models with manually derived models created through traditional procedural modeling techniques. The research demonstrates that integrating AI and machine learning techniques with procedural modeling significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of generating 3D building models. Specifically, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-to-geometry translation, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture generation, showed promising results in creating detailed and realistic 3D structures. This research is significant as it introduces a novel methodology that bridges the gap between traditional procedural modeling and modern AI-driven techniques. It offers a robust solution for automated 3D building modeling, potentially revolutionizing the fields of urban planning and architectural design by enabling more efficient and accurate digital representations of complex building geometries.",

Organizations prepare against cyber attacks by creating Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) that use various technologies to monitor and detect threats and to help perform forensics on machines and networks. Testing the limits of defense technologies and the skill of a CSIRT can be performed through adversary emulation performed by so-called \u201cred teams\u201d. The red team\u2019s work is primarily manual and requires high skill. We propose SpecRep, a system to ease the testing of the detection capabilities of defenses in complex, heterogeneous infrastructures. SpecRep uses previously known attack specifications to construct attack scenarios based on attacker objectives instead of the traditional attack graphs or a list of actions. We create a metalanguage to describe objectives to be achieved in an attack together with a compiler that can build multiple attack scenarios that achieve the objectives. We use text processing tools aided by large language models to extract information from freely available white papers and convert them to plausible attack specifications that can then be emulated by SpecRep. We show how our system can emulate attacks against a smart home, a large enterprise, and an industrial control system.",

However, due to insufficient sensor coverage, traffic state estimation at sensor-free locations (TSES) poses significant challenges for downstream network-wide traffic analysis. This is because direct observations are not available at these sensor-free locations. Most existing traffic state estimation (TSE) research focuses on inferring several unknown time points based on observed historical data using deterministic models. In contrast, TSES is to infer the entire unknown traffic time series of a given sensor-free node, thereby presenting high predictive difficulty, as we could not learn any historical traffic patterns locally. In this study, we introduce a novel probabilistic model \u2014 the conditional diffusion framework with spatio-temporal estimator (CDSTE) \u2014 to tackle the TSES problem. When dealing with TSES, deterministic models can only produce point value estimates, which may substantially deviate from the actual traffic states of sensor-free locations. To mitigate this, the proposed CDSTE integrates the conditional diffusion framework with cutting-edge spatio-temporal networks to extract the underlying dependencies in traffic states between sensor-free and sensor-equipped nodes. This integration enables reliable probabilistic traffic state estimations for sensor-free locations, which can be used to quantify the variability of estimations in TSES to support flexible and robust decision-making processes for traffic management and control. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CDSTE for TSES over five widely-used baseline models.",

In this paper, we target a new task called function-aware urban layout regeneration, and propose UrbanEvolver, a function-aware deep generative model for the task. Given a target region to be regenerated, our model outputs a regenerated urban layout (i.e., roads and buildings) for the target region by considering the function (i.e., land use type) of the target region and its surrounding context (i.e., the functions and urban layouts of the surrounding regions). UrbanEvolver first extracts implicit regeneration rules from the target function and the surrounding context by encoding them separately in different scales through the function-layout adaptive (FA) blocks, and then constrains the regenerated urban layout based on the learned regeneration rules. To enforce the regenerated layout to be valid and to follow the road structure, we design a set of losses covering both pixel-level and geometry-level constraints. To train our model, we collect a large-scale urban layout dataset covering more than 147 K regions under 1300 km2 with rich annotations, including functions, region shapes, urban road layouts, and urban building layouts. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our model outperforms the baseline methods in generating practical and function-aware urban layouts based on the given target function and surrounding context.",

        "abstract":"Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. In certain cases, it becomes challenging to collect any labeled data from downstream scenarios, intensifying the problem further. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model that can exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

        "introduction":"Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. In certain cases, it becomes challenging to collect any labeled data from downstream scenarios, intensifying the problem further. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model that can exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios.",
        "contribution":"Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

        "abstract":"Crime risk map plays a crucial role in urban planning and public security management. Traditionally, it is obtained solely from historical crime incidents or inferred from limited environmental factors, which are not sufficient to accurately model the occurrences of crimes over the geographical space well. Motivated by the impressive and realistic conditional generating power of diffusion models, in this paper, we propose a multimodal conditional diffusion method, namely, DiffCrime, to infer the crime risk map based on datasets in various domains, i.e., historical crime incidents, satellite imagery, and map imagery. It is equipped with a history-gated multimodal denoising network, i.e., HamNet, dedicated to the crime risk map inference. HamNet emphasizes the importance of historical crime data via a Gated-based History Fusion (GHF) module and adaptively controls multimodal conditions to be fused across different diffusion time steps via a Time step-Aware Modality Fusion (TAMF) module. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffCrime, which outperforms baselines by at least 43% and 31% in terms of RMSE, respectively.",

A pivotal contribution to this research lies in the introduction of an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) fortified by the robust capabilities of deep evolving convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This novel security measure is designed to fortify urban energy transactions against potential cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the energy infrastructure. Furthermore, our study introduces a groundbreaking hybridization of the Bat Algorithm (BA) and Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) for the optimization of GAN model training. This fusion of optimization techniques enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the training process, elevating the reliability of the generated models within the context of urban energy management. To validate and demonstrate the practical applicability of these innovations, we deploy them on the real-time dataset of a smart city's digital twin. This implementation serves as a tangible proof of concept, offering valuable insights into the performance and adaptability of the proposed approaches within real-world urban energy scenarios. As the findings unfold, it becomes evident that our research significantly contributes to the evolution of urban energy management, providing a robust foundation for the development of secure, resilient, and community-centric smart city energy systems.

First, a pioneering data architecture design leveraging CycleGAN is proposed to counteract False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA). By cyclically transforming data distributions, CycleGAN ensures the integrity and reliability of smart city information, fortifying against malicious manipulations. Second, an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) concept is introduced, aiming to enhance real-time monitoring and context-aware threat detection within Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Harnessing the wealth of data generated by IoT devices, this concept provides a comprehensive understanding of network activities, fostering adaptive responses to emerging threats. Lastly, the research delves into the development of a novel IDS hyperparameter adjusting system. This system integrates the strengths of Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to fine-tune IDS configuration parameters. Drawing inspiration from biogeographical principles and collaborative whale behavior, the hybrid optimization system balances exploration and exploitation, adapting the IDS to diverse network environments.

        "abstract":"As cities transform, disrupting citizens' lives, their participation in urban development is often undervalued despite its importance. Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes. The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources. The results show that contextual feedback performed better overall, with significant improvements in the pragmatic and hedonic quality, attractiveness, reuse intention, feeling that the complaint is taken seriously, and the citizens' trust in their municipality.",

However, it has also raised concerns amongst researchers over the past decade. In this paper, we present an image-based urban road network generation framework using conditional diffusion models. We first trained a diffusion model capable of generating road images with similar characteristics to the ground truth using four context factors. Then, we used the trained model as the generator to synthesize road images conditioned in a geospatial context. Finally, we converted the generated road images into road networks with several post-processes. The experiments conducted in five cities of the United States showed that our model can generate reasonable road networks, maintaining the layouts and styles of real examples. Moreover, our model has the ability to show the obstructive effect of geographic barriers on urban roads. By comparing models with different context factors as input, we find that the model that considers all four factors generally performs the best. The most important factor in guiding the shape of road networks is intersections, implying that the development of urban roads is not only restricted by the natural environment but is more strongly influenced by human design.",

However, the lack of adequate infrastructure to prevent and predict floods exacerbates this situation. The absence of early warning systems, the scarcity of meteorological and hydrological monitoring stations, and deficiencies in urban planning contribute to the vulnerability of communities to these phenomena. It is imperative to invest in flood prediction and prevention infrastructure, including advanced monitoring systems, the development of hydrological prediction models, and the construction of hydraulic infrastructure, to reduce risk and protect vulnerable communities in Choc\u00f3. Additionally, raising public awareness of the associated risks and encouraging the adoption of mitigation and preparedness measures throughout the population are essential. This study introduces a novel approach for the multivariate prediction of hydrological variables, specifically focusing on water level forecasts for two hydrological stations along the Atrato River in Colombia. The model, utilizing a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, integrates data from hydrological variables, such as the flow, precipitation, and level. With a model architecture featuring four inputs and two outputs, where flow and precipitation serve as inputs and the level serves as the output for each station, the LSTM model is adept at capturing the complex dynamics and cross-correlations among these variables. Validation involves comparing the LSTM model\u2019s performance with linear and nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) models, considering factors such as the estimation error and computational time. Furthermore, this study explores different scenarios for water level prediction, aiming to utilize the proposed approach as an effective flood early warning system.",

These models are particularly adept at addressing the challenges posed by satellite images, which often exhibit domain variability due to seasonal changes, sensor characteristics, and, especially, variations in spectral bands. Such variability can significantly impact model performance across various tasks. In response to these challenges, our work introduces an adaptive approach that harnesses the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GANs), augmented with contrastive learning, to generate target domain images that account for multispectral band variations effectively. By maximizing mutual information between corresponding patches and leveraging the power of GANs, our model aims to generate realistic-looking images across different multispectral domains. We present a comparative analysis of our model against other well-established generative models, demonstrating its efficacy in generating high-quality satellite images while effectively managing domain variations inherent to multispectral diversity.",

In recent years, physics-informed machine learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in crowd simulation but fail to model the heterogeneity and multi-modality of human movement comprehensively.

SPDiff takes both the interactive and historical information of crowds in the current timeframe to reverse the diffusion process, thereby generating the distribution of pedestrian movement in the subsequent timeframe. Inspired by the well-known social physics model, i.e., Social Force, regarding crowd dynamics, we design a crowd interaction module to guide the denoising process and further enhance this module with the equivariant properties of crowd interactions. To mitigate error accumulation in long-term simulations, we propose a multi-frame rollout training algorithm for diffusion modeling.

        "abstract":"In recent years, the application of the internet of things (IoT) in areas such as intelligent transportation, smart cities, and the industrial internet has become increasingly widespread. As a crucial supporting infrastructure, IoT devices are utilized in various fields to construct IoT networks. However, due to the inherent limitations of IoT devices, such as limited computing resources and low memory capacity, security concerns have become increasingly prominent. Among these concerns are Denial-of-Service (DoS) and botnet attacks, which are difficult to prevent due to their large-scale and covert nature. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid DoS Attack Intrusion Detection System (HDA-IDS) that combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to effectively identify both known and unknown DoS\/botnet attacks. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel anomaly-based detection model called CL-GAN. It integrates CNN-LSTM with GAN to establish a baseline for normal behavior and detect malicious traffic. In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in addressing security issues in IoT networks, and presents a general framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale attacks constructed through the dissemination of false information.",

As a crucial supporting infrastructure, IoT devices are utilized in various fields to construct IoT networks. However, due to the inherent limitations of IoT devices, such as limited computing resources and low memory capacity, security concerns have become increasingly prominent. Among these concerns are Denial-of-Service (DoS) and botnet attacks, which are difficult to prevent due to their large-scale and covert nature.",
        "contribution":"To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid DoS Attack Intrusion Detection System (HDA-IDS) that combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to effectively identify both known and unknown DoS\/botnet attacks. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel anomaly-based detection model called CL-GAN. It integrates CNN-LSTM with GAN to establish a baseline for normal behavior and detect malicious traffic. In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in addressing security issues in IoT networks, and presents a general framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale attacks constructed through the dissemination of false information.",

However, gathering and disseminating mobility data face challenges such as data collection, handling of missing information, and privacy protection. An alternative to tackle these problems consists of modeling raw data to generate synthetic data, preserving its characteristics while maintaining its privacy. Thus, we propose MobDeep, a unified framework to compare and evaluate generative models of time series based on mobility data features, which considers statistical and deep learning-based modeling. To achieve its goal, MobDeep receives as input statistical or Generative Adversarial Network-based models (GANs) and the raw mobility data, and outputs synthetic data and the metrics comparing the synthetic with the original data. In such way, MobDeep allows evaluating synthetic datasets through qualitative and quantitative metrics. As a proof-of-concept, MobDeep implements one classical statistical model (ARIMA) and three GANs models. To demonstrate MobDeep on distinct mobility scenarios, we considered an open dataset containing information about bicycle rentals in US cities and a private dataset containing information about a Brazilian metropolis\u2019s urban traffic. MobDeep allows observing how each model performs in specific scenarios, depending on the characteristics of the mobility data. Therefore, by using MobDeep researchers can evaluate their resulting models, improving the fidelity of the synthetic data regarding the original dataset.",

Traditional color plan rendering methods, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs), rely heavily on edge extraction. This often leads to the loss of important details from hand-drawn drafts, significantly affecting the portrayal of the designer\u2019s key concepts. This issue is especially critical in complex park planning. To address this, our study introduces a system based on conditional GANs. This system rapidly converts black-and-white park sketches into comprehensive color designs. We also employ a data augmentation strategy to enhance the quality of the output. The research reveals: (1) Our model efficiently produces designs suitable for industrial applications. (2) The GAN-based data augmentation improves the data volume, leading to enhanced rendering effects. (3) Our unique approach of direct rendering from sketches offers a novel method in urban planning and design. This study aims to enhance the rendering aspect of an intelligent workflow for landscape design. More efficient rendering techniques will reduce the iteration time of early design solutions and promote the iterative speed of designers\u2019 thinking, thus improving the speed and efficiency of the whole design process.",

In this paper, the propose a model aimed at enhancing real-time emergency response capabilities and swiftly identifying criminals. This initiative aims to foster a safer environment and better manage criminal activity within smart cities. The proposed architecture combines an image-to-image stable diffusion model with violence detection and pose estimation approaches. The diffusion model generates synthetic data while the object detection approach uses YOLO v7 to identify violent objects like baseball bats, knives, and pistols, complemented by MediaPipe for action detection. Further, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network classifies the action attacks involving violent objects. Subsequently, an ensemble consisting of an edge device and the entire proposed model is deployed onto the edge device for real-time data testing using a dash camera. Thus, this study can handle violent attacks and send alerts in emergencies. As a result, our proposed YOLO model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 89.5% for violent attack detection, and the LSTM classifier model achieves an accuracy of 88.33% for violent action classification.

Energy theft is a big problem for smart meters and causes non-technical losses. Energy theft attacks can be launched by malicious consumers by compromising the smart meters to report manipulated consumption data for less billing. It is a global issue causing technical and financial damage to governments and operators. Deep learning-based techniques can effectively identify consumers involved in energy theft through power consumption data. In this study, a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-based energy-theft-detection system is proposed to detect data-tampering cyber-attack vectors. CNN is a commonly employed method that automates the extraction of features and the classification process. We employed CNN for feature extraction and traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. In this work, honest data were obtained from a real dataset. Six attack vectors causing data tampering were utilized. Tampered data were synthetically generated through these attack vectors. Six separate datasets were created for each attack vector to design a specialized detector tailored for that specific attack. Additionally, a dataset containing all attack vectors was also generated for the purpose of designing a general detector. Furthermore, the imbalanced dataset problem was addressed through the application of the generative adversarial network (GAN) method. GAN was chosen due to its ability to generate new data closely resembling real data, and its application in this field has not been extensively explored. The data generated with GAN ensured better training for the hybrid CNN-based detector on honest and malicious consumption patterns. Finally, the results indicate that the proposed general detector could classify both honest and malicious users with satisfactory accuracy.",

While several studies have utilized Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for map generation from satellite images, the present work introduces a new approach by integrating contrastive learning into the GAN framework for enhanced map synthesis. Our methodology distinctively employs positive sampling by aligning similar features (e.g., roads) in both satellite images and their corresponding map outputs, and contrasts this with negative samples for disparate elements. This approach effectively replaces the conventional cyclic process in GANs with a more streamlined, unidirectional procedure, leading to improvements in both the quality of the synthesized maps and computational efficiency. We show the effectiveness of our proposed model, offering an advancement in map generation for remote sensing applications.",

Current approaches using ma-chine learning and deep neural networks have advanced traffic prediction but often focus on individual urban dynamic aspects and rely on auto-regressive methods for consecutive predictions, which can be inaccurate and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose the Spatial- Temporal Graph LAtent DIffusion ModeL (STGAIL) to address these limitations. STGAIL views geographical regions as graphs with various traffic features, capturing their interconnections. Operating in a pre-trained latent space, STGAIL uses latent diffusion processes and inno-vative spatial-temporal graph layers for accurate and efficient multi-step predictions. Fine-tuning with temporal binary masks further enhances its performance, avoiding error accumulation and reducing computational costs. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate STGAIL's superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. We also make our code and dataset available, contributing to ongoing research in traffic dynamics prediction.",

Inspired by their natural language processing and pattern recognition functionalities, we attempted to utilize LLMs to simulate the activity patterns of people of different ages and occupations in metropolitan areas (Tokyo). By leveraging pre-processed Person Trip data, we employed 3 methods to test the ability of LLMs to generate urban daily activity data. The results were evaluated based on metrics such as rationality, diversity, and error rates. Results indicate that the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model is capable of accurately simulating the activity distribution patterns of metropolitan populations. Among the prompt-based strategies, the few-shot approach yielded the best performance. Although designing the instruction for prompts and post-processing the data required considerable time, the few-shot prompt strategy proved to be an effective option for this task.",

The ability to provide accurate predictions in what-if scenarios plays a key role in driving the advances in resources optimization and risk mitigation. To this end, prediction models require large datasets to train, and such datasets are usually scarce at local level. In this paper, we propose a generative AI-based workflow to infer domestic photovoltaic energy production data, based on a process that uses Generative Adversarial Networks to generate an enriched meteorological dataset. The generated meteorological data captures essential statistical properties of real data that can be later used to infer realistic energy production data points. The resulting output dataset is validated against a real photovoltaic system, highlighting the ability to deliver high-fidelity time series out of scarce input datasets.",

        "abstract":"Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research.

        "introduction":"Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation.",
        "contribution":"In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research. To support continued research, all source code has been made available under an open-source license.",

Traditional approaches often rely on static data and manual analyses, which can be time-consuming and less responsive to real-time changes. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that integrates Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the principles of strategic engineering to enhance urban planning simulations. By leveraging real-time data and advanced modeling and simulation capabilities, this framework addresses the complexity inherent in urban systems. Generative AI, exemplified by models such as GPT-4, excels at producing coherent and contextually relevant text, while RAG ensures the incorporation of up-to-date, domain-specific information. The framework employs autonomous agents within the simulation software to dynamically model various urban development scenarios, providing planners with actionable insights that promote sustainability. The proposed system enhances decision-making, operational efficiency and community engagement by offering real-time, data-driven insights. Furthermore, it aligns urban development projects with long-term sustainability goals, fostering transparency and public trust. This interdisciplinary approach, rooted in strategic engineering, promises to transform urban planning into a more adaptive, inclusive and resilient practice.",

This paper presents the development and implementation of a Digital Twin (DT) for smart mobility, designed to address these issues. The DT platform integrates a diverse range of historical and real-time data, providing a comprehensive view of urban mobility conditions. Descriptive statistics are employed to identify patterns in parking occupancy and violation frequencies, while Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms enhance predictive and generative analytics for forecasting parking needs and simulating scenarios with other mobility aspects. Advanced analytics uncover hidden patterns and behaviors, and visualization tools map data onto the urban layout to facilitate spatial planning and resource allocation. Scenario simulation enables urban planners to assess the impact of different strategies in a virtual environment prior to real-world implementation. The integration of Generative Artificial Intel- ligence (GenAl) models further enhances predictive capabilities and scenario generation. Preliminary results demonstrate the DT platform's potential in improving urban mobility management, particularly in optimizing parking meter placement and enhancing user experience. Although limited data availability affects long-term prediction accuracy, the model exhibits robustness and adaptability for extended forecasting horizons.",

The Advanced Intelligent Traffic Management System (AITMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to address the persistent challenges of traffic congestion, poor traffic management, and air pollution in densely populated urban areas. Current traffic management systems often rely on static algorithms and predetermined signal timings, which are insufficient to handle dynamic and unpredictable traffic patterns. This results in prolonged travel times, increased fuel consumption, and elevated levels of air pollution, posing serious threats to public health and environmental sustainability. AITMS integrates physical and digital infrastructures, leveraging Generative AI for real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making. By incorporating sensors, IoT devices, and advanced data analytics, the system can predict traffic flow, optimize signal timings, and recommend alternate routes. It also communicates with connected vehicles to provide real-time updates. The incorporation of Generative AI enables the AITMS to continually adapt and learn from new data inputs and trends, ensuring sustainability and scalability in urban transportation. AITMS is an innovative framework enhanced by Generative AI, aimed at revolutionizing urban traffic management in smart cities. Similar frameworks demonstrate promising outcomes, including improved traffic management, reduced congestion, and enhanced driver safety.

        "contribution":"In rapidly urbanizing cities with increasing populations, the challenges of managing traffic are becoming more pressing, highlighting the need for advanced technologies. The Advanced Intelligent Traffic Management System (AITMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to address the persistent challenges of traffic congestion, poor traffic management, and air pollution in densely populated urban areas. Current traffic management systems often rely on static algorithms and predetermined signal timings, which are insufficient to handle dynamic and unpredictable traffic patterns. This results in prolonged travel times, increased fuel consumption, and elevated levels of air pollution, posing serious threats to public health and environmental sustainability. AITMS integrates physical and digital infrastructures, leveraging Generative AI for real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making.

This paper explores the application of LLMs in managing 6G-empowered DT networks, with a focus on optimizing data retrieval and communication efficiency in smart city scenarios. The proposed framework leverages LLMs for intelligent DT problem analysis and radio resource management (RRM) in fully autonomous way without any manual intervention. Our proposed framework - LINKs, builds up a lazy loading strategy which can minimize transmission delay by selectively retrieving the relevant data. Based on the data retrieval plan, LLMs transform the retrieval task into an numerical optimization problem and utilizing solvers to build an optimal RRM, ensuring efficient communication across the network. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvements in data planning and network management, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance the integration of DT and 6G technologies.",

        "abstract":"The rapid development of intelligent industry and smart city increases the number of surveillance devices, greatly enhancing the need for unsupervised automatic anomaly detection in real-Time video surveillance, which uses raw data without laborious manual annotations. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods encounter limitations when utilizing pretext tasks, such as reconstruction or prediction to identify abnormal events, as these tasks are not completely consistent and complementary with the essential objective of anomaly detection. Motivated by recent advances in diffusion models, we propose a multiscale recovery diffusion model, which relies on the proposed novel and effective pretext task named recovery to introduce the notion of generation speed. It utilizes critical step-by-step generation of diffusion probabilistic models in unsupervised anomaly detection scenarios. By incorporating a proposed multiscale spatial-Temporal subtraction module, our model captures more detailed appearance and motion information of foreground objects without relying on other high-level pretrained models. Furthermore, an innovative push-pull loss further extends the disparity between normal and abnormal events through pseudolabels. We validate our model on five established benchmarks: UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and UCF-Crime, achieving frame-level area under the curves of 86.01%, 99.23%, 92.35%, 82.49%, and 74.79%, respectively, surpassing other state-of-The-Art unsupervised VAD methods.",

        "introduction":"The rapid development of intelligent industry and smart city increases the number of surveillance devices, greatly enhancing the need for unsupervised automatic anomaly detection in real-Time video surveillance, which uses raw data without laborious manual annotations. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods encounter limitations when utilizing pretext tasks, such as reconstruction or prediction to identify abnormal events, as these tasks are not completely consistent and complementary with the essential objective of anomaly detection.",
        "contribution":"Motivated by recent advances in diffusion models, we propose a multiscale recovery diffusion model, which relies on the proposed novel and effective pretext task named recovery to introduce the notion of generation speed. It utilizes critical step-by-step generation of diffusion probabilistic models in unsupervised anomaly detection scenarios. By incorporating a proposed multiscale spatial-Temporal subtraction module, our model captures more detailed appearance and motion information of foreground objects without relying on other high-level pretrained models. Furthermore, an innovative push-pull loss further extends the disparity between normal and abnormal events through pseudolabels. We validate our model on five established benchmarks: UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and UCF-Crime, achieving frame-level area under the curves of 86.01%, 99.23%, 92.35%, 82.49%, and 74.79%, respectively, surpassing other state-of-The-Art unsupervised VAD methods.",

        "abstract":"Urban areas face various challenges, including urban planning, waste management, pollution, public safety, and other issues. Information technologies and artificial intelligence have proven helpful in addressing these problems. This paper explores the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to address urban challenges through geospatial analysis. We cover various GenAI models used in urban contexts, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformer-based models (or General Pre-trained Transformer), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative Diffusion models. The paper explains how GenAI can be used for urban analysis applications from an information management perspective. It presents examples of the operations that can be achieved. Additionally, it describes studies related to energy and resource management, urban planning, natural disaster management, and traffic management, demonstrating the advantages of applying this type of technology.

The identification of complex and emerging botnet attacks has not been entirely contained by traditional methods of botnet detection. In this study, we present a new hybrid approach, called GNN-WGAN, to efficiently detect bots in IoT-based smart city networks by integrating Graph Neural Network and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network. The suggested method, which ultimately aims to improve the precision and robustness against botnet detection in dynamic IoT networks, effectively uses WGANs to generate synthetic botnet traffic patterns to add more training data and GNNs to capture dependencies between and interactions across network topology. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GNN-WGAN technique in accurately recognizing botnet activities, which enhances the security and resilience of IoT networks in smart cities.",

Traditional methods, such as face-based and fingerprint-based authentication, usually incur high costs to be installed in all this kind of environments. In this paper, we develop a ubiquitous low-effort user authentication approach, mmPalm, based on palm recognition using millimeter wave (mmWave) signals. mmWave technology has been adopted by WiGig and 5G, making mmPalm a low-cost solution that can be widely adopted in public places. In addition, the high resolution of mmWave signals allows mmPalm to extract detailed palm characteristics (e.g., palm geometry, skin thickness, and texture) that can assemble distinctive palmprints for user authentication. Our innovative virtual antennas design further increases the spatial resolution of a commercial mmWave device, enabling it to fully capture the comprehensive palmprint features. Moreover, to address the challenge of small-scale environmental changes (e.g., variations in palm-device distances and palm orientations), we design a novel palm profile augmentation method, utilizing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic palm profiles for mitigating palm instability. Furthermore, we design a cross-environment adaptation framework based on transfer learning to address the challenge of large-scale environmental changes, including multipath variations introduced by human bodies and nearby furniture. Extensive experiments with 30 participants through 6 months demonstrate that mmPalm achieves 99% authentication accuracy with resilience against different types of attacks, including random, impersonation, and counterfeit.",

This paper explores the potential applications of the Large Language Model (LLM) in facilitating the low-carbon energy transition from an artificial intelligence perspective and summarizes the LLM roles in three directions: simulator, decision-maker, and expert. LLM can simulate low-carbon power scenarios, carbon market dynamics, climate risk assessments, and urban planning strategies. They can also operate power system, integrate renewable energy sources, predict demand patterns, and improve energy efficiency. Furthermore, LLM can serve as an expert in carbon accounting, satellite data interpretation, database management, and sustainable supply chain management. The paper also discusses challenges and future outlooks, including data quality and accessibility, cybersecurity, LLM training costs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evaluation benchmarks. In conclusion, applying LLM in the low-carbon energy transition holds significant potential for driving innovation and sustainability, and further research is needed to maximize their impact.",

        "contribution":"This paper explores the potential applications of the Large Language Model (LLM) in facilitating the low-carbon energy transition from an artificial intelligence perspective and summarizes the LLM roles in three directions: simulator, decision-maker, and expert. LLM can simulate low-carbon power scenarios, carbon market dynamics, climate risk assessments, and urban planning strategies. They can also operate power system, integrate renewable energy sources, predict demand patterns, and improve energy efficiency. Furthermore, LLM can serve as an expert in carbon accounting, satellite data interpretation, database management, and sustainable supply chain management. The paper also discusses challenges and future outlooks, including data quality and accessibility, cybersecurity, LLM training costs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evaluation benchmarks. In conclusion, applying LLM in the low-carbon energy transition holds significant potential for driving innovation and sustainability, and further research is needed to maximize their impact.",

However, since CD labels are difficult to obtain, how to utilize semantic information in RS images to improve the change prediction performance is a problem worth exploring. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based CD method that utilizes a diffusion generation model to translate high-level semantic information into low-level change information. First, we propose a pseudo-change image pair generation method that utilizes semantic labels to guide the diffusion model to generate change images. Then, the refined loss (RL) is designed to improve the model's ability to recognize change features based on the difference between pseudo-change image pairs and unlabeled image pairs. Experimental results on WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and GoogleGZ-CD datasets show that the proposed method effectively transfers the semantic information into change information and finally improves the model's feature recognition ability for change objects. Compared with recent CD and transfer learning methods, the proposed transfer learning model (TLM) achieves the best performance.",

With machine learning seeing wider adoption to forecast the electricity load in smart cities to help maintain grid stability and better integrate with renewable energies, the energy sector is at risk. Although several methods exist to mitigate the problem, adversarial training fails against the attack that utilizes a surrogate model.

As a result, deep learning-based methods gained popularity in recent years. This research paper proposes a novel approach to generating building and residential plans using VAE and GANs. The project started with a VAE with Dall-e, which imposed more constraints on the output image. However, this led to pixelated images that were difficult to interpret. To overcome this, GANs were used, which required fewer constraints to produce more explicit output images. In GANs, two networks are trained simultaneously, a generator network that produces new samples and a discriminator network that evaluates the quality of the generated samples. Through adversarial training, the generator network learns to produce images that resemble the actual samples. The proposed GAN approach can overpower traditional residential plan design methods, producing accurate and high-resolution plans that are easier to interpret. However, using GANs is challenging, with instability in the training process leading to mode collapse or gradient vanishing. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the potential of deep learning-based methods for generating building or residential plans. The proposed approach using VAE and GANs can reduce the effort and time required to design a residential project, making it a valuable tool for architects and urban planners. However, further research is needed to address the challenges associated with GANs and improve the model's performance.",

A super-resolution algorithm based on adversarial training is applied to overcome the challenges of long-range satellite lidar systems. The algorithm generates high-resolution super-resolved outputs from low-resolution inputs, improving the quality of several lidar representations such as canopy height models and profiles. This approach not only advances lidar-based models but also facilitates sophisticated lidar data analysis for various fields, such as environmental science, urban planning, and disaster management. The super-resolved lidar data provides a more precise depiction of the Earth's surface, opening up new avenues for research and applications in different domains. The framework's effectiveness was validated in the Florida Everglades National Park, where the resolution was increased from a 3m x 6m grid with 10m footprints to a 3m x 3m grid with 3m footprints, and the vertical resolution was enhanced from 0.5m to 0.25m.",

Traditionally used to apply artistic styles to images, we adapt NST to transfer the photorealistic qualities of real aerial orthophoto images to synthetic terrain images. This enables the creation of realistic visuals from generated landscapes, addressing the common issues of stylization, abstraction, and inaccuracy in synthetic imagery. Our approach involves upgrading and modifying existing NST techniques and their comparison. The evaluation demonstrates that our methods produce more convincing and realistic results than general generative models. These findings highlight the potential of NST in enhancing the realism of computer-generated landscapes, with possible applications in urban planning, environmental simulations, video games, and the film industry.",

        "abstract":"Hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSIs) have unique advantages in urban planning, precision agriculture, and ecology monitoring since they provide rich spectral information. However, hyperspectral imaging usually suffers from low spatial resolution and high cost, which limits the wide application of hyperspectral data. Spectral super-resolution provides a promising solution to acquire hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution and low cost, taking RGB images as input. Existing spectral super-resolution methods utilize neural networks following a single-shot framework, i.e., final results are obtained by one-stage spectral super-resolution, which struggles to capture and model the complex relationships between spectral bands. In this article, we propose a spectral-cascaded diffusion model (SCDM), a coarse-to-fine spectral super-resolution method based on the diffusion model. The diffusion model fits the real data distribution through stepwise denoising, which is naturally suitable for modeling rich spectral information. We cascade the diffusion model in the spectral dimension to gradually refine the spectral trends and enrich spectral information of the pixels. The cascade solves the highly ill-posed problem of spectral super-resolution step-by-step, mitigating the inaccuracies of previous single-shot approaches. To better utilize the potential of the diffusion model for spectral super-resolution, we design image condition mixture guidance (ICMG) to enhance the guidance of image conditions and progressive dynamic truncation (PDT) to limit cumulative errors in the sampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral super-resolution. Codes can be found at https:\/\/github.com\/Mr-Bamboo\/SCDM.",

However, their application scenarios remain significantly fragmented. Typically, an Autonomous Multi-Functional Vehicle (AMFV) is not engaged in other scenarios when idle in a specific one. Currently, a unified system capable of coordinating and using these resources efficiently is lacking. Moreover, there is an absence of an advanced navigation algorithm for facilitating coordinated navigation among Heterogeneous Vehicles (HVs). To address these issues, we propose the LLM-driven Multi-vehicle Dispatching and navigation (LiMeda) framework. It comprises an LLM-driven scheduling module that facilitates efficient allocation considering task scenarios and vehicle information, which addresses the issue of incompatible vehicle resources across various smart city scenarios. And the other is a navigation module, founded on the Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework we previously proposed, which can effectively perform cooperative navigation tasks among heterogeneous agents, assisting the cooperative task completion by HVs in a smart city. Experimental results show our method outperforms both traditional scheduling algorithms and Reinforcement Learning navigation algorithms in metric terms. Additionally, it shows remarkable scalability and generalization under varying city scales, vehicle numbers, and task numbers.",

In different public locations, such as train stations, airports, hospitals, shopping centers, etc., widespread camera networks are used daily, covering vast areas and having non-overlapping perspectives and providing a tremendous amount of relevant data. We cannot rely on manual monitoring to use this data efficiently for public safety applications and thus need reliable automated systems that can track the behavior of a person through several cameras. Person reidentification (PReID) is a simple task for this and plays a vital role in re-identifying persons from video surveillance cameras. In this paper, we leverage the attention-based mechanism to re-identify persons from video surveillance cameras by using the image modality translation and CycleGAN, which served as data augmentation in our proposed network.

This knowledge is crucial for a variety of fields, such as meteorology and agriculture, environmental science, urban planning and construction, tourism, and cultural preservation. Currently available datasets in the field of scene change understanding primarily concentrate on two main tasks: the detection of changed regions within a scene and the linguistic description of the change content. Existing datasets focus on recognizing discrete changes, such as adding or deleting an object from two images, and largely rely on artificially generated images. Consequently, the existing change understanding methods primarily focus on identifying distinct object differences, overlooking the importance of continuous, gradual changes occurring over extended time intervals. To address the above issues, we propose a novel benchmark dataset, STVchrono, targeting the localization and description of long-term continuous changes in real-world scenes. The dataset consists of 71,900 photographs from Google Street View API taken over an 18-year span across 50 cities all over the world. Our STVchrono dataset is designed to support real-world continuous change recognition and description in both image pairs and extended image sequences, while also enabling the segmentation of changed regions. We conduct experiments to evaluate state-of-the- art methods on continuous change description and segmentation, as well as multimodal Large Language Models for describing changes. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced methods lag human performance, emphasizing the need to adapt them to continuously changing real-world scenarios. We hope that our benchmark dataset will further facilitate the research of temporal change recognition in a dynamic world. The STVchrono dataset is available at STVchrono Dataset.",

Our STVchrono dataset is designed to support real-world continuous change recognition and description in both image pairs and extended image sequences, while also enabling the segmentation of changed regions. We conduct experiments to evaluate state-of-the- art methods on continuous change description and segmentation, as well as multimodal Large Language Models for describing changes. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced methods lag human performance, emphasizing the need to adapt them to continuously changing real-world scenarios. We hope that our benchmark dataset will further facilitate the research of temporal change recognition in a dynamic world. The STVchrono dataset is available at STVchrono Dataset.",

In this study, we designed a Spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced multi-TAsk GEnerative adversarial network (GAN), named STAGE, to generate synthetic trajectories that statistically resemble the real data without recycling personal information. In STAGE, we designed a multi-task generator with three stages of spatio-temporal generation tasks, i.e. activity-sequence generation task, township-level trajectory generation task, and neighborhood-level trajectory generation task, with the last one as the main task while the other two as auxiliary tasks. Meanwhile, we designed a spatial consistency loss in the adversarial training process to assess the spatial consistency of generated trajectories at different spatial scales. Experiment results show that compared to the baselines, trajectories generated by our method have closer data distributions to the real ones. We argued that the designs of spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced generation tasks and training loss benefit the spatiotemporal generation processes, which help reproduce the temporal patterns of human daily activities and spatial distribution of human movements.",

Despite this, data trading faces challenges like the absence of robust pricing methods and the lack of trustworthy trading mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce a traffic-oriented data trading platform named Data on The Move (DTM), integrating traffic simulation, data trading, and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents. The DTM platform supports evident-based data value evaluation and AI-based trading mechanisms. Leveraging the common sense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess traffic state and data value, DTM can determine reasonable traffic data pricing through multi-round interaction and simulations. Moreover, DTM provides a pricing method validation by simulating traffic systems, multi-agent interactions, and the heterogeneity and irrational behaviors of individuals in the trading market. Within the DTM platform, entities such as connected vehicles and traffic light controllers could engage in information collecting, data pricing, trading, and decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed AI agent-based pricing approach enhances data trading by offering rational prices, as evidenced by the observed improvement in traffic efficiency. This underscores the effectiveness and practical value of DTM, offering new perspectives for the evolution of data markets and smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study employing LLMs in data pricing and a pioneering data trading practice in the field of intelligent vehicles and smart cities.",

The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns. This study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing the semantic analysis of trajectory data, paving the way for more sophisticated and accessible human mobility research.",

However, in current practice, the usability of street view images is hindered by low-light conditions, and existing low-light enhancement methods often overlook the high-frequency characteristics specific to street views. Therefore, this paper proposes a conditional diffusion model called SVBoost that incorporates high-frequency information and color balance to achieve targeted enhancement of street view images. The proposed model demonstrates favorable performance in terms of image quality, and the enhancement effect observed in semantic segmentation tasks suggests the potential of this method for downstream applications.",

Meanwhile, security and privacy risks have emerged, including the presence of various malware, resulting in detrimental consequences. Generative attack networks (GAN) can not only build superior representations for complex and multi-dimensional data but also maximise prediction performance due to their min-max optimisation manner. This paper proposes a GAN approach, utilising an autoencoder (AE) as the generator and a transfer learning for the discriminator, to identify various types of malware threats that exploit the IoT network using RGB images collected directly from malware samples. The generator is built for effective data reconstruction, with different AE structures and denoising manner; the discriminator utilises a pre-trained MobileNet for maximised performance. Two well-known image classification models, VGG19 and Xception, are used for performance comparison. The experiment proves that the Variational AE-GAN is highly implementable and scalable for the malware classification task, in both detection performance and generalizability.",

Integration of UAV imagery provides high-resolution spatial data, facilitating precise classification of land cover types. Federated learning (FL) ensures data privacy and reduces communication bandwidth usage by enabling model training on local devices (e.g., UAVs) without the need to share data with a centralized server. However, these UAVs have limited resources and often struggle to capture a sufficient number of images for training a model without encountering overfitting. We address the challenges of scarce data samples on UAVs by leveraging DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate synthetic images, promoting sustainability by minimizing the need for extensive data collection. These synthetic images are used to train local models of UAVs, offering enhanced results while combating overfitting. Our developed FL model achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, indicating a 7% improvement over Vanilla FL. The proposed sustainable approach exhibits promising outcomes in achieving accurate and scalable land cover and land use classification, showcasing its applicability in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and precision agriculture.",

This study, on the Virtual Singapore (VSg) CDT platform, explores how the platform\u2019s existing data, interactivity and 3D visualisation capabilities can facilitate rapid proto typing through generative machine learning techniques trained on the city\u2019s unique planning texture; and discusses the challenges and limitations of the platform in supporting the development of such tools, along with potential improvements.

Many researchers have explored generative urban block design using either rule-based or deep learning methods. However, these methods often fall short inadequately capturing morphological features and essential design indicators like building density. Latent diffusion models, particularly in the context of urban design, offer a ground breaking solution. These models can generate cityscapes directly from text descriptions, incorporating a wide array of design indicators. This paper introduces a novel workflow that utilizes Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, to generate 3D urban environments. The process involves reconstructing 3D urban block models from generated depth images, employing a systematic depth-to-height mapping technique. Additionally, the paper explores the extrapolation between various urban morphological characteristics, aiming to generate novel urban forms that transcend existing city models. This innovative approach not only facilitates the accurate generation of urban blocks with specific mor phological characteristics and design metrics, such as building density, but also demonstrates its versatility through application to thre edistinct cities. This methodology, tested on select cities, holds potential for broader range of urban environments and more design indicators, setting the stage for future computational urban design research.",

Satellite image segmentation is necessary to analyze pictures and extract particular information for applications including urban planning, vegetation monitoring, and time series data analysis due to their complexity. Most segmentation models need input images of size (512,512), which may lead to pixelation or quality reduction due to cropping or zooming. High resolution input data might provide challenges in multiclass segmentation due to its extensive coverage area. This paper present a remodeled Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) to enhance picture quality and maintain crucial data for precise segmentation tasks. The segmentation process involves utilizing a U-Net architecture integrated with a ResNet50 encoder. This decision was taken to utilise ResNet50's advanced feature extraction skills while preserving U-Net's efficacy in obtaining contextual information for accurate segmentation. The network incorporates the Tversky loss function to effectively adjust the influence of various classes in the input data throughout the training process. The model demonstrates an accuracy of 0.94 and a mean Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.83 in multiclass segmentation tasks, properly outlining different land cover classes such as houses, woodlands, water bodies, and roads.",

Engaging the public in this process promises to achieve high acceptance for resulting endeavors but poses significant challenges, particularly due to the varying levels of technical and artistic skills among participants. Moreover, discussions and collaborative efforts in urban planning often lack practical visualization tools, making it difficult to imagine and debate future urban scenarios. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a promising technology capable of bridging these gaps. GenAI can generate natural language output and visual content from textual descriptions, offering a novel way to facilitate more inclusive and productive participation in urban planning processes. In this paper, we explore the application of GenAI in a participatory urban planning event utilizing the novel Prompt-a-thon format. We conducted a study involving 64 participants who utilized GenAI in small groups to envision, design, and discuss the future urban landscape of the metropolitan city of Hamburg in Germany. Through this process, we examined the human-AI collaboration, assessing the technology's ability to accommodate varying skills and improve visualization in planning discussions. Our findings indicate that GenAI contributes to leveling diverse skill sets of participants, enabling more people to contribute insights into urban planning discussions. The technology also proved effective in overcoming visualization barriers, thus facilitating more engaging and fruitful discussions about future urban scenarios. These results underscore the potential of GenAI as a valuable tool in the evolving landscape of urban planning and public participation.",

This research addresses this challenge by introducing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in conjunction with satellite maps. Based on the inherent interconnectedness between traffic noise and urban morphology elements, the research proposes a GAN model-based framework capable of generating noise heat maps from high-resolution satellite maps, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative. This research also examines how model performance is influenced by input images through qualitative and quantitative methods. Using New York City as a case study, the proposed GAN-based models demonstrate accuracy in predicting noise distributions. Three parameters of input images likely to be influential in noise prediction accuracy were proposed. We also compare the model performance in different urban contexts. The study presents a valuable tool for architects and urban planners, enabling optimized urban planning and design strategies.",

As wireless communication devices are commonly used, cellular station data has become integral for estimating population figures and studying their movement, thereby implying significant contributions to urban planning. However, existing research grapples with issues pertinent to preprocessing base station data and the modeling of population prediction. To address this, we propose methodologies for preprocessing cellular station data to eliminate any irregular or redundant data. The preprocessing reveals a distinct cyclical characteristic and high-frequency variation in population shift. Further, we devise a multi-view enhancement model grounded on the Transformer (MVformer), targeting the improvement of the accuracy of extended time-series population predictions. Comparative experiments, conducted on the above-mentioned population dataset using four alternate Transformer-based models, indicate that our proposed MVformer model enhances prediction accuracy by approximately 30% for both univariate and multivariate time-series prediction assignments. The performance of this model in tasks pertaining to population prediction exhibits commendable results.",

With the increasing popularity of open-world games, studies on building virtual environments have become increasingly important for the game research community and industry. The game development team must engage in urban planning, designate important locations, create population assets, integrate game design, and assemble these elements into a cohesivelooking city. Based on our limited knowledge and survey, we are the first to propose a holistic approach that integrates all features in generating a city, including the natural features surrounding it. We employ a generative adversarial network architecture to create a realistic layout of an entire city from scratch. Subsequently, we utilize classical computer vision techniques to post-process the layout into separate features. The chosen model is a simple Convolutional GAN, trained on a modest dataset of 2x2 km\u00b2 snippets from over two thousand cities around the world. Although the method is somewhat constrained by the resolution of the images, the results indicate that it can serve as a solid foundation for building realistic 3D cities.",

With the increasing popularity of open-world games, studies on building virtual environments have become increasingly important for the game research community and industry. The game development team must engage in urban planning, designate important locations, create population assets, integrate game design, and assemble these elements into a cohesivelooking city. Based on our limited knowledge and survey, we are the first to propose a holistic approach that integrates all features in generating a city, including the natural features surrounding it. We employ a generative adversarial network architecture to create a realistic layout of an entire city from scratch. Subsequently, we utilize classical computer vision techniques to post-process the layout into separate features. The chosen model is a simple Convolutional GAN, trained on a modest dataset of 2x2 km\u00b2 snippets from over two thousand cities around the world. Although the method is somewhat constrained by the resolution of the images, the results indicate that it can serve as a solid foundation for building realistic 3D cities.",

While access to sunlight is essential to the success of urban environments, shadows can provide shaded places to stay during the hot seasons, mitigate heat island effect, and increase pedestrian comfort levels. Properly quantifying sunlight access and shadows in large urban environments is key in tackling some of the important challenges facing cities today. In this paper, we propose Deep Umbra, a novel computational framework that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale. Our framework is based on a conditional generative adversarial network that considers the physical form of cities to compute high-resolution spatial information of accumulated sunlight access for the different seasons of the year. We use data from seven different cities to train our model, and show, through an extensive set of experiments, its low overall RMSE (below 0.1) as well as its extensibility to cities that were not part of the training set. Additionally, we contribute a set of case studies and a comprehensive dataset with sunlight access information for more than 100 cities across six continents of the world. Deep Umbra is available at http:\/\/urbantk.org\/shadows .",

While access to sunlight is essential to the success of urban environments, shadows can provide shaded places to stay during the hot seasons, mitigate heat island effect, and increase pedestrian comfort levels. Properly quantifying sunlight access and shadows in large urban environments is key in tackling some of the important challenges facing cities today.",
        "contribution":"In this paper, we propose Deep Umbra, a novel computational framework that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale. Our framework is based on a conditional generative adversarial network that considers the physical form of cities to compute high-resolution spatial information of accumulated sunlight access for the different seasons of the year. We use data from seven different cities to train our model, and show, through an extensive set of experiments, its low overall RMSE (below 0.1) as well as its extensibility to cities that were not part of the training set. Additionally, we contribute a set of case studies and a comprehensive dataset with sunlight access information for more than 100 cities across six continents of the world. Deep Umbra is available at http:\/\/urbantk.org\/shadows .",

        "abstract":"The increasing number of vehicles has led to issues such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and energy consumption. Intelligent connected autonomous driving (AD) offers a solution to these transportation challenges, but it requires cooperation among dedicated AD road networks, connected cloud-based control and dispatch systems, and intelligent vehicle sensing. To harness the potential of AD, it is crucial to consider the requirements of autonomous vehicles (AVs) when planning road networks. Well-designed road networks can enhance travel experiences, reduce energy consumption, and promote urban sustainability. In order to meet the needs of AD while ensuring the operational efficiency of urban transportation networks, this paper introduces a road network evaluation framework that encompasses both static and dynamic assessment criteria, following a detailed exploration and analysis of various road network generation methods. This evaluation framework addresses the deficiency in existing road network generation methods, which lack dynamic assessment of traffic networks. To validate the proposed approach, we have chosen a road network generation method based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) as an application example. Through carefully designed experiments, we confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for generating and evaluating road networks tailored for AD scenarios.",

A key challenge in trajectory generation is to best capture the basic characteristics of the long sequences of location points.

This paper presents TS-TrajGAN, a two-stage model to generate spatiotemporal trajectory data by combining a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a conditional GAN. We train the GAN of stage I to simulate the distribution of the initial trajectory segments such that the basic characteristics of the length-limited initial trajectory segments can be well depicted. In stage II, the conditional GAN is used to predict the next location point for the current generated trajectory and preserve the variability in individuals\u2019 mobility. In addition, a predictor network is added to the GAN of stage I for trajectory length prediction. Experiments on a real-world taxi dataset demonstrate that TS-TrajGAN is not only able to generate trajectories that have similar characteristics with the real ones, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of data utility.

        "abstract":"The rapid urbanization trend in most developing countries including India is creating a plethora of civic concerns such as loss of green space, degradation of environmental health, scarcity of clean water, rise in air pollution, and exacerbated traffic congestion resulting in significant delays in vehicular transportation. To address the intricate nature of transportation issues, many researchers and planners have analyzed the complexities of urban and regional road systems using transportation models by employing transportation indices such as road length, network density, accessibility, and connectivity metrics. This study addresses the complexities of predicting road network density for small and medium-sized Indian cities that come under the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) project at a national level. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and the CityGAN model is introduced to predict network density using spatial indicators of human settlements. The major goal of this study is to generate hyper-realistic urban patterns of small and medium-sized Indian cities using an unsupervised CityGAN model and to study the causal relationship between human settlement indices (HSIs) and transportation index (network density) using supervised KRR for the real cities. The synthetic urban universes mimic Indian urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through the settlement indices can aid in comprehending urban landscape, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. We analyzed 503 real cities to find the actual relationship between the urban settlements and their road density. The nonlinear KRR model may help urban planners in deriving the network density for GAN-generated futuristic urban patterns through the settlement indicators. The proposed hybrid process, termed as RidgeGAN model, can gauge the sustainability of urban sprawl tied to infrastructure and transportation systems in sprawling cities. Analysis results clearly demonstrate the utility of RidgeGAN in predicting network density for different kinds of human settlements, particularly for small and medium Indian cities. By predicting future urban patterns, this study can help in the creation of more livable and sustainable areas, particularly by improving transportation infrastructure in developing cities.",

However, in regions where earthquakes do not occur frequently, model construction may be difficult due to a lack of training data. To address this issue, there is a need for technology that can generate earthquake scenarios for response training at any location. We proposed a model for generating earthquake scenarios using an auxiliary classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN)-based data synthesis. The proposed ACGAN model generates various earthquake scenarios by incorporating an auxiliary classifier learning process into the discriminator of GAN. Our results at borehole sensors showed that the seismic data generated by the proposed model had similar characteristics to actual data. To further validate our results, we compared the generated IM (such as PGA, PGV, and SA) with Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPE). Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of using the generated scenarios for earthquake early warning training. The proposed model and algorithm have significant potential in advancing seismic analysis and detection management systems, and also contribute to disaster management.",

Research based on Local Climate Zone (LCZ) has exhibited promising potential for disentangling the interactive mechanisms between urban morphology and local climate. In this study, generative adversarial networks (GAN) were employed as surrogate models to facilitate the integration of LCZ and urban morphology data from six metropolises for associative training. Through comparative experiments involving quantitative and qualitative evaluations, a rapid and responsive 3D morphology prediction model was developed for LCZ classifications. The results demonstrated the superior convergence capabilities and accuracy of the Pix2pix model (RMSE = 0.187 and R2 = 0.878) when compared to the CycleGAN model (RMSE = 0.344 and R2 = 0.674). The predicted 3D morphologies showcased a pronounced alignment with their respective LCZs, as evidenced by the precise representation of open low-rise buildings and their interrelationships with the coastline in the Sydney sample, as well as the accurate portrayal of the complex urban morphology shaped by compact high-rise buildings and road networks in the Tokyo sample. Utilizing indices calculated from the 3D morphology, the model yielded an average overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient, and F1 score of 85.2%, 0.83, and 0.86, respectively, indicating the robustness and adaptability of the model. The framework presented in this research offers practitioners a solid foundation and valuable insights for enhancing the local climate in urban areas through the implementation of 3D generative design techniques.",

Among the various basic units carrying urban functions, residential community plays a vital part for supporting human life. Therefore, the layout planning of residential community has always been of concern, and has attracted particular attention since the advent of deep learning that facilitates the automated layout generation and spatial pattern recognition. However, the research circles generally suffer from the insufficiency of residential community layout benchmark or high-quality datasets, which hampers the future exploration of data-driven methods for residential community layout planning. The lack of datasets is largely due to the difficulties of large-scale real-world residential data acquisition and long-term expert screening. In order to address the issues and advance a benchmark dataset for various intelligent spatial design and analysis applications in the development of smart city, we introduce Residential Community Layout Planning (ReCo) Dataset, which is the first and largest open-source vector dataset related to real-world community to date. ReCo Dataset is presented in multiple data formats with 37,646 residential community layout plans, covering 598,728 residential buildings with height information. ReCo can be conveniently adapted for residential community layout related urban design tasks, e.g., generative layout design, morphological pattern recognition and spatial evaluation. To validate the utility of ReCo in automated residential community layout planning, two Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generative models are further applied to the dataset. We expect ReCo Dataset to inspire more creative and practical work in intelligent design and beyond.

However, the collected urban flows are usually rather unreliable, may contain noise and sometimes are incomplete, thus posing great challenges to existing approaches. In this paper, we present a pioneering study on robust fine-grained urban flow inference with noisy and incomplete urban flow observations, and propose a denoising diffusion model named DiffUFlow to effectively address it with an improved reverse diffusion strategy. Specifically, a spatial-temporal feature extraction network called STFormer and a semantic features extraction network called ELFetcher are proposed. Then, we overlay the extracted spatial-temporal feature map onto the coarse-grained flow map, serving as a conditional guidance for the reverse diffusion process. We further integrate the semantic features extracted by ELFetcher to cross-attention layers, enabling the comprehensive consideration of semantic information for fine-grained flow inference. Extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract":"In Smart City and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems, acquiring pedestrians' accurate locations is crucial to traffic and pedestrian safety. Current systems adopt cameras and wireless sensors to estimate people's locations via sensor fusion. Standard fusion algorithms, however, become inapplicable when multi-modal data is not associated. For example, pedestrians are out of the camera field of view, or data from the camera modality is missing. To address this challenge and produce more accurate location estimations for pedestrians, we propose a localization solution based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. During training, it learns the underlying linkage between pedestrians' camera-phone data correspondences. During inference, it generates refined position estimations based only on pedestrians' phone data that consists of GPS, IMU, and FTM. Results show that our GAN produces 3D coordinates at 1 to 2 meters localization error across 5 different outdoor scenes. We further show that the proposed model supports self-learning. The generated coordinates can be associated with pedestrians' bounding box coordinates to obtain additional camera-phone data correspondences. This allows automatic data collection during inference. Results show that after fine-tuning the GAN model on the expanded dataset, localization accuracy is further improved by up to 26%.",

One way to protect a system from an attack is to use machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs), significantly improving classification tasks. Training ML algorithms require a large network traffic dataset; however, large storage and months of recording are required to capture the attacks, which is costly for IoT environments. This study proposes an ML pipeline using the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) model to generate a synthetic dataset. Then, the synthetic dataset was evaluated using several types of statistical and ML metrics. Using a decision tree, the accuracy of the generated dataset reached 0.99, and its lower complexity reached 0.05 s training and 0.004 s test times. The results show that synthetic data accurately reflect real data and are less complex, making them suitable for IoT environments and smart city applications. Thus, the generated synthetic dataset can further train models to secure IoT networks and applications.",

However, the real-world human trajectory data tends to be limited by user privacy or device acquisition issues, leading to its insufficient quality to support the above applications. Hence, generating human trajectory data is a crucial but challenging task, which suffers from the following two critical challenges: 1) how to capture the user distribution in human trajectories (group view), and 2) how to model the complex mobility patterns of each user trajectory (individual view). In this paper, we propose a novel human trajectories generator (named VOLUNTEER), consisting of a user VAE and a trajectory VAE, to address the above challenges. Specifically, in the user VAE, we propose to learn the user distribution with all human trajectories from a group view. In the trajectory VAE, from the individual view, we model the complex mobility patterns by decoupling travel time and dwell time to accurately simulate individual trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art baselines. Further application analysis in the industrial system also demonstrates the effectiveness of our model.",

In this paper, we develop a generative adversarial machine learning network to characterize the temporal and spatial mobility behavior of public transit passengers, based on massive smart card data and road network data. The Apriori algorithm is extended with spatio-temporal constraints to extract frequent transit mobility patterns of individual passengers based on a reconstructed personal trip dataset. This individual-level pattern information is used to construct personalized feature vectors. For regular and frequent public transit passengers, we identify similar transit mobility groups using spatio-temporal constraints to construct a group feature vector. We develop a generative adversarial network to embed public transit mobility of passengers. The proposed model\u2019s generator consists of an auto-encoder, which extracts a low-dimensional and compact representation of passenger behavior, and a pre-trained sub-generator containing generalization features of public transit passengers. Shenzhen City is taken as the study area in this paper, and experiments were carried out based on smart card data, road network data, and bus GPS data. Clustering analysis of embedding vector representation and estimation of the top K transit destinations were conducted, verifying that the proposed method can profile passenger transit mobility in a comprehensive and compact manner.",

Tree planting, a crucial aspect of green infrastructure, has been analyzed for optimized positioning using data metrics, priority scoring, and GIS. However, due to the dynamic nature of environmental information, the accuracy of current approaches is compromised. This study aims to present a novel approach integrating deep learning and cellular automata to prioritize urban tree planting locations to anticipate the optimal urban tree network. Initially, GIS data were collated and visualized to identify a suitable study site within London. CycleGAN models were trained using cellular automata outputs and forest mycorrhizal network samples. The comparison validated cellular automata\u2019s applicability, enabled observing spatial feature information in the outputs and guiding the parameter design of our 3D cellular automata system for predicting tree planting locations. The locations were optimized by simulating the network connectivity of urban trees after planting, following the spatial-behavioral pattern of the forest mycorrhizal network. The results highlight the role of robust tree networks in fostering ecological stability and cushioning climate change impacts in urban contexts. The proposed approach addresses existing methodological and practical limitations, providing innovative strategies for optimal tree planting and prioritization of urban green infrastructure, thereby informing sustainable urban planning and design. Our findings illustrate the symbiotic relationship between urban trees and future cities and offer insights into street tree density planning, optimizing the spatial distribution of trees within urban landscapes for sustainable urban development.",

        "abstract":"Extracting roads from remote sensing images is of significant importance for automatic road network updating, urban planning, and construction. However, various factors in complex scenes (e.g., high vegetation coverage occlusions) may lead to fragmentation in the extracted road networks and also affect the robustness of road extraction methods. This study proposes a multi-scale road extraction method with asymmetric generative adversarial learning (MS-AGAN). First, we design an asymmetric GAN with a multi-scale feature encoder to better utilize the context information in high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and feature fusion are integrated into the asymmetric encoder\u2013decoder structure to avoid feature redundancy caused by multi-level cascading operations and enhance the generator network\u2019s ability to extract fine-grained road information at the pixel level. Second, to maintain road connectivity, topologic features are considered in the pixel segmentation process. A linear structural similarity loss ((Formula presented.)) is introduced into the loss function of MS-AGAN, which guides MS-AGAN to generate more accurate segmentation results. Finally, to fairly evaluate the performance of deep models under complex backgrounds, the Bayesian error rate (BER) is introduced into the field of road extraction for the first time. Experiments are conducted via Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images with high vegetation coverage in the Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the public DeepGlobe dataset. The performance of MS-AGAN is compared with a list of advanced models, including RCFSNet, CoANet, UNet, DeepLabV3+, and DiResNet. The final results show that (1) with respect to road extraction performance, the Recall, F1, and IoU values of MS-AGAN on the Daxing dataset are 2.17%, 0.04%, and 2.63% higher than the baselines. On DeepGlobe, the Recall, F1, and IoU of MS-AGAN improve by 1.12%, 0.42%, and 0.25%, respectively. (2) On road connectivity, the Conn index of MS-AGAN from the Daxing dataset is 46.39%, with an improvement of 0.62% over the baselines, and the Conn index of MS-AGAN on DeepGlobe is 70.08%, holding an improvement of 1.73% over CoANet. The quantitative and qualitative analyses both demonstrate the superiority of MS-AGAN in preserving road connectivity. (3) In particular, the BER of MS-AGAN is 20.86% over the Daxing dataset with a 0.22% decrease compared to the best baselines and 11.77% on DeepGlobe with a 0.85% decrease compared to the best baselines. The proposed MS-AGAN provides an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable method for the dynamic updating of road networks via HRSIs.",

This study presents the process of developing the AI model, which suggests appropriate land use plans for user-targeted sites and urban density scenarios. We first create an image dataset that embeds land use, floor area ratio (FAR), and building cover ratio (BCR) information in the RGB channel. Then, an algorithm is developed for establishing an optimized training set with 1000 images and methods for validating the obtained results from both quantitative and visual perspectives. We set up a pilot test to generate three urban density scenarios in Sewoon-Sangga district by constructing urban data-encoded image datasets of Seoul. The pilot test results reveal that our proposed model successfully suggests appropriate land use plans according to the three scenarios. Based on the pilot test, the AI advisor improves its output, training performance, and usability by reflecting block morphology with the Hamming distance and accepting user-designed road patterns.

Deep generative learning gives us hope that we can automate this planning process and come up with the ideal urban plans. While remarkable achievements have been obtained, they have exhibited limitations in lacking awareness of: 1) the hierarchical dependencies between functional zones and spatial grids; 2) the peer dependencies among functional zones; and 3) human regulations to ensure the usability of generated configurations. To address these limitations, we develop a novel human-instructed deep hierarchical generative model. We rethink the urban planning generative task from a unique functionality perspective, where we summarize planning requirements into different functionality projections for better urban plan generation. To this end, we develop a three-stage generation process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function. The third stage is to leverage multi-attentions to model the zone-zone peer dependencies of the functionality projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

To this end, we develop a three-stage generation process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function. The third stage is to leverage multi-attentions to model the zone-zone peer dependencies of the functionality projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

        "abstract":"Haze significantly impacts various fields, such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and security monitoring. Deep learning has been proven effective in removing haze from images. However, obtaining pixel-aligned hazy and clear paired images in the real world can be challenging. Therefore, synthesized hazed images are often used for training deep networks. These images are typically generated based on parameters such as depth information and atmospheric scattering coefficient. However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images.

        "introduction":"Haze significantly impacts various fields, such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and security monitoring. Deep learning has been proven effective in removing haze from images. However, obtaining pixel-aligned hazy and clear paired images in the real world can be challenging. Therefore, synthesized hazed images are often used for training deep networks. These images are typically generated based on parameters such as depth information and atmospheric scattering coefficient.",
        "contribution":"However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images. This method has broadened the applications of deep learning in haze removal, particularly highlighting its potential in the fields of autonomous driving and smart cities.",

Reasonable data analysis can provide a crucial foundation for the development of market behavior by considering the enormous amount of data generated by a market economy. To this end, we propose enhanced cluster generative adversarial networks (eClusterGAN) to achieve latent space clustering. However, data storage security is crucial. Moreover, we suggest a GAN-based network intrusion detection system (GAN\u2013NIDS) that uses adversarial learning to assist the generator in learning the spatial distribution of normal network flows. The simulation results showed that the proposed eClusterGAN and GAN\u2013NIDS outperformed the benchmarks in terms of clustering accuracy, running time, precision, recall, and F1, which can support researchers in studying economic data trends. The construction of Smart Cities can effectively ensure healthy market development by discovering and disseminating the potential value of market economic data.",

However, to obtain effective urban plans, urban experts have to spend much time and effort analyzing sophisticated planning constraints based on domain knowledge and personal experiences. To alleviate the heavy burden of them and produce consistent urban plans, we want to ask that can AI accelerate the urban planning process, so that human planners only adjust generated configurations for specific needs? The recent advance of deep generative models provides a possible answer, which inspires us to automate urban planning from an adversarial learning perspective. However, three major challenges arise: (1) how to define a quantitative land-use configuration? (2) how to automate configuration planning? (3) how to evaluate the quality of a generated configuration? In this article, we systematically address the three challenges. Specifically, (1) We define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor. (2) We formulate the automated urban planning problem into a task of deep generative learning. The objective is to generate a configuration tensor given the surrounding contexts of a target region. In particular, we first construct spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data crawled from websites to learn graph representations. We then combine each target area and its surrounding context representations as a tuple, and categorize all tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Next, we develop an adversarial learning framework, in which a generator takes the surrounding context representations as input to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish between positive and negative samples. (3) We provide quantitative evaluation metrics and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

        "abstract":"Cloud interference is a significant challenge in remote sensing applications, impacting the quality and reliability of data used for environmental analysis, disaster monitoring, and urban planning. In this study, we present an innovative approach to remove clouds from remote sensing data by employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with an integrated attention mechanism. Our method is designed to effectively restore regions obscured by clouds while preserving the integrity of the remaining image. We introduce a specialized architecture called U-net based Attention GAN (UAGAN) to address cloud cover issues. In this architecture, the generator network utilizes attention mechanisms to identify and rectify cloud-affected areas. The attention mechanism dynamically emphasizes relevant spatial regions during cloud removal, enhancing the precision of the restoration process. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments using the RICE dataset and trained our UAGAN model. Our method's effectiveness was assessed using quantitative metrics, including the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Comparative analysis of three different models, namely vanilla GAN, U-net GAN, and UAGAN, demonstrates that UAGAN outperforms the others with impressive results, achieving a PSNR of 29.901 dB, RMSE of 7.891, and SSIM of 0.971.This research contributes to the advancement of cloud removal techniques in remote sensing, offering a promising solution for improving data quality and enhancing the accuracy of downstream applications. The integration of GANs and attention mechanisms showcases the potential for innovative approaches to address complex challenges in remote sensing data analysis.",

        "contribution":"In this study, we present an innovative approach to remove clouds from remote sensing data by employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with an integrated attention mechanism. Our method is designed to effectively restore regions obscured by clouds while preserving the integrity of the remaining image. We introduce a specialized architecture called U-net based Attention GAN (UAGAN) to address cloud cover issues. In this architecture, the generator network utilizes attention mechanisms to identify and rectify cloud-affected areas. The attention mechanism dynamically emphasizes relevant spatial regions during cloud removal, enhancing the precision of the restoration process. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments using the RICE dataset and trained our UAGAN model. Our method's effectiveness was assessed using quantitative metrics, including the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Comparative analysis of three different models, namely vanilla GAN, U-net GAN, and UAGAN, demonstrates that UAGAN outperforms the others with impressive results, achieving a PSNR of 29.901 dB, RMSE of 7.891, and SSIM of 0.971.This research contributes to the advancement of cloud removal techniques in remote sensing, offering a promising solution for improving data quality and enhancing the accuracy of downstream applications. The integration of GANs and attention mechanisms showcases the potential for innovative approaches to address complex challenges in remote sensing data analysis.",

To address limitations in trajectory generation methods that treat all points equally, this study proposes a two-stage trajectory simulation model that generates separate sequences for stopping points and moving points. By differentiating between these two types of points, the model can effectively capture mobility intentions and moving paths. The stopping point sequence generator utilizes a GAN-based approach to capture mobility intentions and patterns, while the moving point generator constructs a weighted directed road network graph to determine efficient paths between stopping points. Extensive experiments using a real-life mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in generating realistic trajectories.

Leveraging the generative power of GANs, the optimization capabilities of genetic algorithms, and the spatial analysis capabilities of GIS, UrbanGenoGAN is designed to generate optimized urban plans that cater to various urban planning challenges.

Frontier AI refers to the forefront of AI technology, encompassing the latest advancements, innovations, and experimental techniques in the field, especially AI foundation models and LLMs. Foundation models, like GPT-4, are large, general-purpose AI models that provide a base for a wide range of applications. They are characterized by their versatility and scalability. LLMs are obtained from fine-tuning foundation models with a specific focus on processing and generating natural language. They excel in tasks like language understanding, text generation, translation, and summarization. By leveraging vast textual data, including traffic reports and social media interactions, LLMs extract critical insights, fostering the evolution of ITS. The survey navigates the dynamic synergy between LLMs and ITS, delving into applications in traffic management, integration into autonomous vehicles, and their role in shaping smart cities. It provides insights into ongoing research, innovations, and emerging trends, aiming to inspire collaboration at the intersection of language, intelligence, and mobility for safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation systems. The paper further surveys interactions between LLMs and various aspects of ITS, exploring roles in traffic management, facilitating autonomous vehicles, and contributing to smart city development, while addressing challenges brought by frontier AI and foundation models. This paper offers valuable inspiration for future research and innovation in the transformative domain of intelligent transportation.",

Frontier AI refers to the forefront of AI technology, encompassing the latest advancements, innovations, and experimental techniques in the field, especially AI foundation models and LLMs. Foundation models, like GPT-4, are large, general-purpose AI models that provide a base for a wide range of applications. They are characterized by their versatility and scalability. LLMs are obtained from fine-tuning foundation models with a specific focus on processing and generating natural language. They excel in tasks like language understanding, text generation, translation, and summarization. By leveraging vast textual data, including traffic reports and social media interactions, LLMs extract critical insights, fostering the evolution of ITS. The survey navigates the dynamic synergy between LLMs and ITS, delving into applications in traffic management, integration into autonomous vehicles, and their role in shaping smart cities. It provides insights into ongoing research, innovations, and emerging trends, aiming to inspire collaboration at the intersection of language, intelligence, and mobility for safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation systems. The paper further surveys interactions between LLMs and various aspects of ITS, exploring roles in traffic management, facilitating autonomous vehicles, and contributing to smart city development, while addressing challenges brought by frontier AI and foundation models. This paper offers valuable inspiration for future research and innovation in the transformative domain of intelligent transportation.",

        "abstract":"While techniques for assessing solar potential, particularly on roofs, are well-established, estimating solar potential on building facades often requires more work due to the complexity of urban features and the elaborate design of building facades. Existing methods to assess the solar potential of building facades often neglect the characteristics of individual facades. This study presents an image-based method for a more accurate estimation of the PV potential of facades. The proposed method is composed of four steps: (1) data acquisition, preprocessing, and manual labeling, (2) training a pixel-wise semantic image segmentation model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), (3) color content analysis of segmented images, and (4) estimating the annual solar energy potential. We apply the proposed workflow to several buildings in Zurich, Switzerland, and evaluate segmentation quality and resulting changes in fa\u00e7ade surface utilization factors. In a comparative analysis between the widely used web-based solar potential assessment tools, Sonnenfassade, Global Solar Atlas and the simulation software Climate Studio, we demonstrate the downstream impact of surface utilization factors on resulting solar potentials. Considerable deviations in fa\u00e7ade availability for BIPV deployments among the various tools as compared to our segmentation approach indicate the potential impact of the proposed method on policy-making and the benefits for BIPV design and planning.",

In this paper, we propose the use of Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (Tabular GAN) for generating synthetic data for residential electricity consumption. Tabular GANs have been used in various domains and have shown promising results in generating high-quality synthetic data. The performance of our proposed method was evaluated by comparing the probability density, mean, standard deviation, and variances of the synthetic data with the original data. The results showed that the Tabular GAN method generated synthetic data that closely match the statistical characteristics of the original data and the simulation outcome indicated that the synthetic data generated by Tabular GAN could effectively simulate the patterns and behaviors observed in the original data. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness of using Tabular GANs for generating synthetic electricity consumption data.",

These applications often require dense trajectories, which is often not the case due to power limitations and privacy concerns. To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network-based model, namely TIGAN, for trajectory imputation. TIGAN inserts artificial GPS points between real ones, resulting in imputed trajectories that closely resemble those collected at much higher sampling rates. Unlike existing works, TIGAN does not require prior knowledge such as underlying road networks. Moreover, TIGAN incorporates transportation modes into trajectory imputation, leading to much better performance. Evaluation in two real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of TIGAN over state-of-the-art methods.",

It is possible to visualize future landscapes by making sketches and models, but this requires a great deal of skill and effort on the part of the creator. One method for visualizing future landscapes without the need for specialized skills or labor is image generation using deep learning, and a method has been proposed of using deep learning to generate landscape images after demolishing current buildings. However, there are two problems: the inability to remove arbitrary buildings and the inability to generate a landscape after reconstruction. Therefore, this study proposes a future landscape visualization method that integrates instance segmentation and a diffusion model. The proposed method can generate both post-removal images of existing buildings and post-reconstruction images based on text input, without the need for specialized technology or labor. Verification results confirmed that the post-removal image was more than 90% accurate when the building was removed and replaced with the sky. And the post-reconstruction image matched the text content with a best accuracy of more than 90%. This research will contribute to the realization of urban planning in which all project stakeholders, both professionals and the public, can directly participate by visualizing their own design proposals for future landscapes.",

To address these problems, recent research focuses on generating synthetic trajectories, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained by real-world trajectories. In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets show the superiority of our model in various metrics over state-of-the-art models.",

To address these problems, recent research focuses on generating synthetic trajectories, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained by real-world trajectories.",
        "contribution":"In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets show the superiority of our model in various metrics over state-of-the-art models.",

However, the release of original trajectory data violates privacy protection principles if no privacy-preserving approach is adopted, that's why the public trajectory data for research is so limited. To enable extensive available trajectory data publishing, we propose a Privacy-Preserving and research-utilizable Trajectory Generator (PPTG), which uses a deep generative model to provide utilizable synthetic trajectories. Specifically, PPTG can not only extract the intrinsic and spatial features, but also get rid of possible privacy information from the real trajectories. In experiments, we show that the privacy-preserving trajectory data generated by PPTG can achieve superior performance in terms of privacy protection and data utility against the existing approaches.",

Distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging infrastructure play a vital role in the planning and construction of smart cities. However, the uncertainty associated with the power output of distributed generation significantly impacts the planning of distribution networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability. Additionally, in terms of algorithm efficiency, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms tested in terms of the number of iterations and speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed planning model in improving the economy and stability of the distribution network. Furthermore, it enhances the computational efficiency of the planning problem associated with distributed power supply and electric vehicle charging stations. The findings of this research hold substantial research significance for the site selection planning of distributed power supply.",

        "abstract":"Background. As an important part of smart cities, smart water environmental protection has become an important way to solve water environmental pollution problems. It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

However, the accuracy and reliability of high-resolution day-ahead wind power forecasting are constrained by unreliable local weather prediction and incomplete power generation data. This article proposes a physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) surrogates method to augment the incomplete dataset and quantify its uncertainty to improve wind power forecasting performance. The incomplete dataset, built with numerical weather prediction data, historical wind power generation, and weather factors data, is augmented based on generative adversarial networks. After augmentation, the enriched data is then fed into a multiple AI surrogates model constructed by two extreme learning machine networks to train the forecasting model for wind power. Therefore, the forecasting models\u2019 accuracy and generalization ability are improved by mining the implicit physics information from the incomplete dataset. An incomplete dataset gathered from a wind farm in North China, containing only 15 days of weather and wind power generation data with missing points caused by occasional shutdowns, is utilized to verify the proposed method\u2019s performance. Compared with other probabilistic forecasting methods, the proposed method shows better accuracy and probabilistic performance on the same incomplete dataset, which highlights its potential for more flexible and sensitive maintenance of smart grids in smart cities.",

The explosion of mobility data prompted the application of deep learning to human mobility. Along with the growth of research interest, there is also increasing privacy concern. This study first examines the cutting-edge approaches for trajectory generation, classification, and next-location prediction. Second, we propose a novel privacy-aware approach for predicting next-week trajectories. The approach is based on two modules, a Generative Adversarial Network used for generating synthetic trajectories and a deep learning model for user identification which safeguards privacy. These two modules are combined with a next-week trajectory predictor that uses privacy-aware synthetic data. The experiments on two real-life datasets show that the generator creates trajectories similar to the real ones yet different enough to safeguard privacy. The low user-recognition recognition accuracy of models trained on the generated data demonstrates privacy awareness. Statistical tests confirm no significant difference between the original and the generated trajectories. We further demonstrate the utility of the synthetic data by predicting week-ahead trajectories based on the synthetic trajectories. Our study shows how privacy and utility can be managed jointly using the proposed privacy-aware approach.",

Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities. This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different fa\u00e7ade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments. HIGHLIGHTS Machine learning use in outdoor thermal comfort assessment has been investigated. Vegetation, urban geometry, surface albedo, and water bodies have been studied parameters. Vegetation and street orientation have the highest and water bodies have the least impact on outdoor thermal comfort. Pix2pix algorithm implementation could create thermal comfort maps with 96% SSIM.",

Recently, several empirical studies and emerging theory provided support for the fact that many different urban indicators follow general consistent statistical patterns across countries, cultures and times. In particular, total personal income, measures of innovation, crime rates, characteristics of the built environment and other indicators have been shown to exhibit non-linear power-law scaling with the population size of functional cities. Here, we show how to apply this type of analysis inside cities to establish universal patterns in the quantity and distribution of urban amenities such as restaurants, parks, and universities. Using a unique data set containing millions of amenities in the 50 largest US metropolitan areas, we establish general non-linear scaling patterns between each city\u2019s population and many different amenities types, the small-area statistics of their spatial abundance, and the characteristics of their mean distance to each other. We use these size-specific statistical findings to produce generative models for the expected amenity abundances of any US city. We then compute the deviations observed in given cities from this statistical many-amenity model to build a characteristic signature for each urban area. Finally, we show how urban planning can be guided by these systemic quantitative expectations in the context of new city design or the identification of local deficits in service provision in existing cities.",

In this study, a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is used to construct a method for deriving the distribution of urban texture through the distribution hotspots of the COVID-19 epidemic.

In this study, taking Macau as an example, this method was used to conduct model training, image generation, and comparison of the derivation results of different assumed epidemic distribution degrees. The implications of this study for urban planning are as follows: (1) there is a correlation between different urban forms and the distribution of epidemics, and CGAN can be used to predict urban forms with high epidemic risk; (2) large-scale buildings and high-density buildings can promote the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; (3) green public open spaces and squares have an inhibitory effect on the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; and (4) reducing the volume and density of buildings and increasing the area of green public open spaces and squares can help reduce the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

Currently, performance-based urban and building design relies on a time-consuming numerical simulation process, hindering performance optimization early in the design process. This paper proposes an automated design process that applies generative adversarial network (GAN) as a surrogate model to accelerate environmental performance-driven urban design. Parameterized urban blocks are designed for random sampling and constructing a numerical simulation database. The GAN model was trained to predict pedestrian level wind (PLW), annual cumulative solar radiation (Radiation) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in real-time. The GAN-based surrogate model is combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve real-time optimization of urban morphology. The results show that on the test set, the pix2pix model using a specific encoding method predicts the R2 of 0.70, 0.86 and 0.80 for PLW, Radiation and UTCI, respectively, while the method can speed up 120\u2013240 times compared to the numerical simulation method. The optimization results show that NSGA-II combined with global averaging pooling achieves the best optimization results. When the number of optimized samples exceeds 174, the proposed method has a time advantage over traditional methods for outdoor environment optimization in urban design.",

Monitoring and forecasting urban cellular traffic is fundamental for urban planning, network resources allocation, traffic engineering, etc. In this paper, we address the crowdsourcing-based urban cellular traffic prediction problem, i.e., to predict the city-scale fine-grained cellular traffic patterns based on partial user-generated measurements. We propose a novel deep generative adversarial network (GAN) model called CrowdGAN to solve the problem. Specifically, CrowdGAN employs a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract spatio-temporal features from sparse traffic maps, and adopts a novel design of co-training a generator and a discriminator under the supervision of an accuracy assurance network to generate a high-resolution cellular traffic map for prediction. We implement the proposed CrowdGAN in TensorFlow and evaluate its performance using two real-world cellular traffic datasets. Extensive experiments show that CrowdGAN significantly outperforms the baselines on a variety of performance metrics, and achieves at least 47% reduction in root-mean-squared error compared to the state-of-the-art.",

GANs can be useful in the built environment, from processing large-scale urban mobility data and remote sensing images at the regional level, to performance analysis and design generation at the building level. We analyzed 100 articles to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on how GANs are currently applied to solve challenging tasks in the built environment. Our results show that: (i) GANs are replacing older methods in some problems and setting state-of-the-art performances; (ii) GANs are opening new frontiers in previously overlooked problems, such as automatically generating spatially accurate floorplan layouts; (iii) GANs can be applied to different scales in the built environment, from entire cities to neighborhoods and buildings; and (iv) GANs are being used in a variety of problems and data types, from remote sensing data augmentation, vector data generation, spatio-temporal data privacy protection, to building design generation. In total, there are 26 unique application domains enabled by GANs; (v) however, one common challenge in this field currently is the lack of high-quality datasets curated specifically for problems in the built environment. With more data in the future, GANs could potentially produce even better results than today.",

However, even the most well-funded surveying agencies rely on sampling methods to estimate the nature of the true population, and the collected microdata is frequently aggregated, or limited in volume and detail to protect the privacy of respondents. Population synthesis provides a means to scale this microdata to represent larger regions for use in microsimulation. Despite their accuracy and widespread adoption, traditional synthesis algorithms for reweighting microdata samples scale poorly with the number of variables and geographic regions being modeled, and can suffer from non-convergence with smaller sample sizes. Several generative models have been proposed to address these shortcomings, but lack features such as sub-region modeling, and the ability to simultaneously generate both individuals and households. This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE\/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE\/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4\u201316 variables). The VAE\/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples.",

Recent studies have shown that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have the potential to shed light on this task. However, existing GAN-based models are limited by the sparsity of urban data and instability in model training, hampering their applications. Here, we propose a GAN framework with geographical knowledge, namely Metropolitan GAN (MetroGAN), for urban morphology simulation. We incorporate a progressive growing structure to learn hierarchical features and design a geographical loss to impose the constraints of water areas. Besides, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for the complex structure of urban systems. Results show that MetroGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art urban simulation methods by over 20% in all metrics. Inspiringly, using physical geography features singly, MetroGAN can still generate shapes of the cities. These results demonstrate that MetroGAN solves the instability problem of previous urban simulation GANs and is generalizable to deal with various urban attributes.",

Removing air pollutants generated by various emission sources is crucial to control PM2.5, improve air quality, and maintain human health in high-density urban areas. In response to air pollution, urban vegetation plays an essential role in providing air quality regulation service. To estimate the air quality regulation service provided by urban vegetation, this study integrated spatial analysis, a dry deposition model, and an atmospheric diffusion model to spatially quantify the air quality regulation service of PM2.5 in Taipei City on a high-resolution scale (30 m \u00d7 30 m per spatial unit). The results show that in 2016, total PM2.5 emissions in Taipei City were 1,400.88 tonnes and that urban vegetation removed 18.31 tonnes of PM2.5, with an average PM2.5 removal rate of 0.16 g\/m2, and the corresponding PM2.5 concentration improvement value of 0.0136 \u03bcg\/m3. This finding revealed a significant gap between the amounts of emissions and purifications of PM2.5, the air quality regulation service provided by the urban vegetation in Taipei City remains insufficient. The results of this study not only point out the spatial differences of regulation services and propose a new research framework for quantifying the natural benefits, but also as a guideline for governments to form the auxiliary policies of the urban ecosystem service and facilitate the urban green infrastructure planning.",

We propose a novel 'off-deployment traffic estimation problem', namely, to foresee the traffic condition changes of a region prior to the deployment of a construction plan. This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer. We evaluate our TrafficGAN using a large-scale traffic data collected from Shenzhen, China. Results show that TrafficGAN can more accurately estimate the traffic conditions compared with all baselines. We also showcase that TrafficGAN can identify potential traffic issues in some regions and suggest possible reasons.",

In this study, we proposed a self-powered smart transportation infrastructure skin (SSTIS) as an innovative and bionic system for the traffic classification of a smart city. This system incorporated the self-powered flexible sensors with net-zero power consumption based on the Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) and an intelligent analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI). The feasibility of the SSTIS was tested using the full-scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) and the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with a vehicle axle load classification accuracy up to 89.06%. This robust SSTIS was later tested on highway and collected around 869,600 pieces of signals data. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN - Gradient Penalty) was used for data augmentation, due to the imbalanced data of different vehicle types in actual traffic. The overall accuracy for on-road vehicle type classification improved to 81.06% using the convolutional neural network ResNet. Finally, we developed a mobile traffic signal information monitoring system based on cloud platform and Android framework, which enabled engineers to obtain the vehicle axle-load information mobilely. This study is the emerging design and engineering application of the self-powered flexible sensors for smart traffic monitoring, which provides a significant advance for intelligent transportation and smart cities in future.",

        "abstract":"Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent city construction and public crisis management. Distinct from the single trajectory prediction which rely on strong temporal correlation, in the complex scenes, the trajectory reflects not only the temporal characteristics of a single person, but the interactive features between human and other moving objects nearby. Therefore, how to deeply describe such temporality and interactivity, and then to generate accurate trajectory prediction results according to the change of the scene has become a major problem in the field of trajectory prediction today. In recent years, deep learning has attracted great attention and achieved success in the trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods capture the influence between pedestrians from a single view, and they fail to consider the multiple factors which have an effect on the decision of pedestrians, such as going straight or turning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time.",

Automatic understanding of the scene, and the associated provision of situational awareness for emergency situations, are able to efficiently contribute to such domains. In this study, a Video Analytics Edge Computing (VAEC) system is presented that performs real-time enhanced situation awareness for person detection in a video surveillance manner that is also able to share geolocated person detection alerts and other accompanied crucial information. The VAEC system adopts state-of-the-art object detection and tracking algorithms, and it is integrated with the proposed Distribute Edge Computing Internet of Things (DECIoT) platform. The aforementioned alerts and information are able to be shared, though the DECIoT, to smart city platforms utilizing proper middleware. To verify the utility and functionality of the VAEC system, extended experiments were performed (i) in several light conditions, (ii) using several camera sensors, and (iii) in several use cases, such as installed in fixed position of a building or mounted to a car. The results highlight the potential of VAEC system to be exploited by decision-makers or city authorities, providing enhanced situational awareness.",

Due to the coupling relationship of generative factors in spatial-temporal domain, it is challenging to model the citywide traffic dynamics under a structural pattern of critical features such as hours of days, days of weeks and weather conditions. To address this challenge, this article develops a disentangled representation learning framework to learn an interpretable factorized representation of the independent data generative factors. In order to make full use of the knowledge on generative factors, this article proposes spatial-temporal generative adversarial network (ST-GAN) to assign the generative factors of traffic flow to the feature vector in latent space and reconstructs the high-dimensional citywide traffic flow from the given factors. With the help of the disentangled representations, the decomposed feature vector in latent space discloses the relationship between underlying patterns and citywide traffic dynamics.

With the help of crowdsourced data and generative adversarial networks (GAN), a generation model was trained to provide colorful rendering of master plans similar to those produced by experienced urban designers. Approximately 5000 master plans from Pinterest were processed and CycleGAN was applied as the core algorithm to build this model, the so-called MasterplanGAN. Using the uncolored input design files in an AutoCAD format, the MasterplanGAN can provide master plan renderings within a few seconds. The validation of the generated results was achieved using quantitative and qualitative judgments. The achievements of this study contribute to the development of automatic generation of previously subjective and experience-oriented processes, which can serve as a useful tool for urban designers and planners to save time in real projects. It also contributes to push the methodological boundaries of urban design by addressing urban design requirements with new urban data and new techniques. This initial exploration indicates that a large but clear picture of computational urban design can be presented, integrating scientific thinking, design, and computer techniques.",

These extend to various areas in sustainability, including for satellite image analysis to obtain information such as land usage and extent of development. An interesting direction for which data-driven methods have not been applied much yet is in the quick quantitative evaluation of urban layouts for planning and design. In particular, urban designs typically involve complex trade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up and\/or consideration of urban heat island effect. Hence, it can be beneficial to urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban characteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity, without having to run compu-tationally expensive and time-consuming high-fidelity numerical simulations each time. This fast surrogate can then be potentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including generative models or other gradient-based methods. Here we present an investigation into the use of convolutional neural networks as a surrogate for urban layout characterization that is typically done via high-fidelity numerical simulation. We then further apply this model towards a first demonstration of its utility for data-driven pedestrian-level wind velocity prediction. The data set in this work comprises results from high-fidelity numerical simulations of wind velocities for a diverse set of realistic urban layouts, based on randomized samples from a real-world, highly built-up urban city. We then provide prediction results obtained from the neural network trained on this data-set, demonstrating test errors of under 0.1 m\/s for previously unseen novel urban layouts. We further illustrate how this can be useful for purposes such as rapid evaluation of pedestrian wind velocity for a potential new layout. In addition, it is hoped that this data set will further inspire, facilitate and accelerate research in data-driven urban AI, even as our baseline model facilitates quantitative comparison to future, more innovative methods.",

To address these issues a number of methods for generating synthetic yet realistic trajectory datasets have been proposed. These existing methods either require a lot of complex parameters to be calibrated (simulators) or rely on existing trajectory datasets (generative models). In this paper, we propose Data-Driven Trajectory Generator, dubbed DDTG, a data-driven, model-free, and parameter-less algorithm for generating realistic synthetic vehicle trajectory datasets. Unlike existing approaches, DDTG relies on aggregate origin-destination and traffic data, both of which are publicly available and free of privacy concerns. Furthermore, we show that our method is orthogonal to the existing approaches with which DDTG can be combined to generate synthetic datasets of higher quality. Our experiments with real-world trajectory and traffic data show that the datasets generated by DDTG follow distributions that are very close to the distributions of real trajectory datasets.",

Once traffic estimation is performed in a 'new' city where many urban services and transportation infrastructures are not built and thus no prior data is available, those works would fail due to the lack of data. In this paper, we aim to solve the conditional urban traffic estimation problem in case of data scarcity (i.e., the target city cannot provide any prior data) and tackle the main challenges including (1) knowledge learning from the source and (2) knowledge adaptation without prior traffic data. We propose a novel generative adversarial network - Meta Spatial-Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (Mest-GAN), which can successfully estimate traffic in the target city based on local travel demands without the access to any prior traffic data. To address the first challenge, we learn the latent distribution of travel demands with the inference network, the latent distribution also indicates the diverse spatial-temporal traffic patterns. To solve the second challenge, we use the travel demand data in the target city for adaptation, where the inference network infers a latent code guiding the generator to produce accurate traffic estimations. Extensive experiments on real-world multiple-city datasets demonstrate that our Mest-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Current research uses data mining of tweets and specific posts to provide population trends, but there is no work done in social network analysis for the same end. This paper proposes an applied informatics application with social network usage to aid in the lack of data due to nonexistent traffic sensors. The Twitter API was used to download a network of users that follows traffic updates accounts and then, use a model of information diffusion (independent cascade model) to retrieve a variable that holds a metric of how the information regarding current traffic has traveled through the network. Finally, an updated traffic dataset with the new social network variable is used to train and validate an LSTM neural network to show if the new variable can be a predictor for traffic. Results show that a deterministic independent cascade model ran on a New York City-based 2-tier social network marginally improved the prediction by 0.4%. This proposal can be replicated in other information diffusion models.",

        "abstract":"Accurate multi-step citywide urban flow prediction plays a critical role in traffic management and future smart city. However, it is very challenging since urban flow is affected by complex semantic factors and has multi-scale dependencies on both spatial and temporal dimensional features. Moreover, it\u2019s difficult for most existing one-step urban flow prediction models to predict several future time steps in a short time accurately. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in video prediction and image generation, in this paper we propose a Seq2Seq Spatial-Temporal Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks named STS-GAN for multi-step urban flow prediction. We regard citywide urban flow data in successive time steps as image frames of a video. Specifically, we first design a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Encoder (STSE) to capture relative semantic factors and spatial-temporal dependencies simultaneously at each time step, which consists of Residual Convolution units. Then a Seq2Seq GAN model is proposed to generate a sequence of future urban flow predictions based on historical data. Furthermore, by integrating GAN\u2019s adversarial loss with prediction error, our STS-GAN can effectively address the blurry prediction issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale urban flow datasets in Beijing and Guangzhou, which demonstrate STS-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods.",

As design and planning functions increasingly overlap, it is the hope that technologies like machine learning and other digital tools will evolve and proliferate to enable designers to employ data-driven analyses in informing a wider range of design decisions. This chapter proposes a potential use case for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the planning and design process. GANs are used to develop novel impressionistic aerial imagery\u2014or urban impressions\u2014based on a variety of inputs common to practice such as variations of land use and\/or land cover. The GANs make extensive use of readily-available, tiled, web-format maps in both their training and prediction. The generated urban impressions were evaluated based on a range of qualitative criteria, including their ability to foster increased dialogue between parties. Additionally, this research included the development of a prototype tool that creates urban impressions based on selected inputs early on in the predesign phase. Ultimately, it is the hope that this prototype \u201csketch tool\u201d will allow practitioners to use GANs to test out initial \u201csketched\u201d approaches in planning and design and communicate them to the client for early feedback.",

There is a need for street designs that encourages cooperation between road users. Shared space is a street design approach that softens the demarcation of vehicles and pedestrian traffic by reducing traffic rules, traffic signals, road marking, and regulations. Understanding the interactions and trajectory formations of various VRUs will facilitate the design of safer shared spaces. In line with this goal, this paper aims to develop a methodology for generating VRUs trajectories that accounts for behaviors and social interactions. We develop a receding horizon optimization-based pedestrian trajectory planning algorithm capable of modeling pedestrian trajectories in a variety of shared space scenarios. Focusing on three scenarios-group interactions, unidirectional interaction, and fixed obstacle interaction-case studies are performed to demonstrate the strengths of the resulting generative model. Additionally, generated trajectories are validated using two benchmark datasets - DUT and TrajNet++. The three case studies are shown to yield low or near-zero Mean Euclidean Distance and Final Displacement Error values supporting the performance validity of the models. We also analyze gait parameters (step length and step frequency) to further demonstrate the model's capability at generating realistic pedestrian trajectories.",

        "abstract":"Urban traffic data plays an important role in urban transportation planning. Due to the scarcity of real-life urban traffic data, many transportation planning applications need to generate synthesized traffic flows based on the real-life trajectory datasets. However, those synthesized traffic flows can only fit the input trajectories, which are static and does not reflect the real traffic distributions. In this paper, we use a stochastic origin-destination (OD) matrix to represent the density of the dynamic traffic flows and then develop a dynamic traffic flow generator. We extract the stochastic OD matrix from the trajectory data, design an efficient neural network to the predict successive stochastic OD matrices, and deploy our model on a real-world road network. The proposed model surpasses the existing generative model in RMSE, MAE, VAR, KL indicators, and is significantly better than the existing model in the MAE indicator. Our traffic generator is able to dynamically adjust urban traffics to generate different simulation environments.",

        "abstract":"Existing deep learning technologies generally learn the features of chest X-ray data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia). A large number of truthful reports make the verification of our model can effectively diagnose COVID-19 without compromising privacy.",

An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured three-dimensional (3D) virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include clouds, which degrade image quality. These clouds can be removed by using a generative adversarial network (GAN), which leads to improvements in training quality. Therefore, the objective of this research was to propose a method for automatically generating building mask images by using 3D virtual models with textured aerial photographs. In this study, using GAN to remove clouds in aerial photographs improved training quality. A model trained on datasets generated by the proposed method was able to detect buildings in aerial photographs with IoU = 0.651.",

Nevertheless, the implementation of sensing applications in urban scale meets serious challenges in terms of sensing costs and quality. For example, data sparsity will arise due to sensing ability and cost, and the measurements could contain noise or errors. Therefore, missing data inference with low-quality measurements is critical. To tackle these challenges, we design a low-cost crowdsensing system by missing data inference incorporating with active sensing grids selection. Specifically, an adversarial autoencoder (AAE)-based scheme is proposed for missing data inference. This model applies VAE to learn latent variables and generates full data and further utilizes the adversarial nets to play a min-max game with the autoencoder. Furthermore, an active learning-based method is designed to iteratively select sensing grids to further reduce the cost. The proposed scheme can handle large missing rate, both random and block missing patterns, and is robust against measurement noise. Comprehensive experiments based on three data sets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

Real-time uncooperative monitoring of people has numerous applications ranging from smart cities and transport to IoT and security. In e-healthcare, PWR technology could be used for ambient assisted living and early detection of chronic health conditions. Large training datasets could drive forward machine-learning-focused research in the above applications. However, generating and labeling large volumes of high-quality, diverse radar datasets is an onerous task. Therefore, we present an open-source motion capture data-driven simulation tool, SimHumalator, that can generate large volumes of human micro-Doppler radar data at multiple IEEE WiFi standards(IEEE 802.11g, n, and ad). We qualitatively compare the micro-Doppler signatures generated through SimHumalator with the measured signatures. To create a more realistic training dataset, we artificially add noise to our clean simulated spectrograms. A noise distribution is directly learned from real radar measurements using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We observe improvements in the classification performances between 3 to 8%. Our results suggest that simulation data can be used to make adequate training data when the available measurement training support is low.",

Ride-request data has been crucial in the research of improving ride-hailing efficiency and minimizing the cost. This work aims to model human mobility patterns to generate realistic ride-requests, addressing the prevailing problem of lack of historical training data and realistic synthetic data for different hypothetical scenarios. Synthetic generation also inherently carries anonymity. In particular, our work focuses on modeling both spatial and temporal distributions jointly for ride-hailing services. A Ride-Request Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (RR-WGAN) is proposed to generate plausible pick-up and drop-off geolocations. The generated ride-requests are extensively evaluated under a wide range of criteria we design, giving a comprehensive understanding of how the model performs. The proposed approach has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art methods in most scenarios. We believe this approach could provide value for ride-hailing service providers, research communities, and policy-makers.",

        "abstract":"Rapid developments in urbanization and smart city environments have accelerated the need to deliver safe, sustainable, and effective resource utilization and service provision and have thereby enhanced the need for intelligent, real-time video surveillance. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems. In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual appearance.",

To effectively improve the pedestrian gender recognition performance, a new method, called cascading scene and viewpoint feature learning (CSVFL), is proposed in this article. The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled\/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint. Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly used pedestrian attribute data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CSVFL approach outperforms multiple recently reported pedestrian gender recognition methods.",

In this paper, a newfangled end-to-end model is proposed for advanced driving assistance based on the fusion of infrared and visible images, termed as FusionADA. In our model, we are committed to extracting and fusing the optimal texture details and salient thermal targets from the source images. To achieve this goal, our model constitutes an adversarial framework between the generator and the discriminator. Specifically, the generator aims to generate a fused image with basic intensity information together with the optimal texture details from source images, while the discriminator aims to force the fused image to restore the salient thermal targets from the source infrared image. In addition, our FusionADA is a fully end-to-end model, solving the issues of manually designing complicated activity level measurements and fusion rules existing in traditional methods.

In this work, we present the first generative model of city blocks named BlockPlanner, and showcase its ability to synthesize valid city blocks with varying land lots configurations. We propose a novel vectorized city block representation utilizing a ring topology and a two-tier graph to capture the global and local structures of a city block. Each land lot is abstracted into a vector representation covering both its 3D geometry and land use semantics. Such vectorized representation enables us to deploy a lightweight network to capture the underlying distribution of land lots configurations in a city block. To enforce intrinsic spatial constraints of a valid city block, a set of effective loss functions are imposed to shape rational results. We contribute a pilot city block dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our representation and framework over the state-of-the-art. Notably, our BlockPlanner is also able to edit and manipulate city blocks, enabling several useful applications, e.g., topology refinement and footprint generation.",

        "abstract":"Given historical traffic distributions and associated urban conditions observed in a city, the conditional urban traffic estimation problem aims at estimating realistic future projections of the traffic under a set of new urban conditions, e.g., new bus routes, rainfall intensity and travel demands. The problem is important in reducing traffic congestion, improving public transportation efficiency, and facilitating urban planning. However, solving this problem is challenging due to the strong spatial dependencies of traffic patterns and the complex relations between the traffic and urban conditions. In this paper, we tackle the challenges by proposing a novel Complex-Condition-Controlled Urban Traffic Estimation through Generative Adversarial Networks (C3-GAN) for urban traffic estimation of a region under various complex conditions. C3-GAN features the following three novel designs on top of standard cGAN model: (1) an embedding network mapping the complex conditions to a latent space to find representations of the urban conditions; (2) an inference network to enhance the relations between the embedded latent vectors and the traffic data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our C3-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Inspired by image generation, deep urban planning aims to leverage deep learning to generate land-use configurations. However, urban planning is a complex process. Existing studies usually ignore the need of personalized human guidance in planning, and spatial hierarchical structure in planning generation. Moreover, the lack of large-scale land-use configuration samples poses a data sparsity challenge. This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present extensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method.",

To deal with cyberattacks against such networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is built to recognize and alert to the system administrator for further appropriate response. Currently, machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) has been explored and is still being developed. However, these systems give a high rate of false alert and are easily deceived by sophisticated attacks such as variants of attacks containing perturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously evaluate and improve these systems by simulating mutation of real-world network attack. Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks. The experiments are performed and evaluated through 2 criteria: Detection rate (DR) and F1 Score (F1) on the public dataset, named CICIDS2017. DIGFuPAS can be used for continuously pentesting and evaluating IDS's capability once integrated as an automated sustainability test pipeline for SDN-enabled networks.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network based detection method of deep morphed deepfake images which is suitable for IoT environments in smart cities. A high accuracy of 94.83% has been achieved for the DeepfakeTIMIT HQ dataset. This lightweight and fast network is a natural choice for IoT environments.",

To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction. In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen. An unsupervised adversarial loss is also employed in the network to minimize the difference between generated synthetic and original data in the training process. Experiments on real datasets indicate that the data generated by Airgen could significantly increase the prediction accuracy performed by deep learning models. The mean square error (MSE) is remarkably reduced from 0.024 to 0.015.",

Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, began to implement its first area, around the iconic Hoan Kiem lake, a few years ago. In most of cases, however, road closure is likely to deport traffic to nearby neighbourhoods with the consequences of intensifying congestion and, possibly, increasing air pollution in these areas. Because this outcome might appear counter-intuitive to most stakeholders, it is becoming more and more necessary to analyse, assess and share the impacts of these developments in terms of traffic and pollution shifts before implementing them. In this project, we used the GAMA platform to build an agent-based model that simulates the traffic, its emissions of air pollutants, and the diffusion of these pollutants in the district of Hoan Kiem. This simulation has been designed so as to serve either as a decision support tool for local authorities or as an awareness-raising tool for the general public: thanks to its display on a physical 3D model of the district, people can effectively and naturally interact with it at public venues. Although more accurate data and more realistic diffusion models are necessary and will need further research in the future, the simulation is already able to reflect traffic and air pollution peaks during rush hours, allowing residents and developers to understand the impact of pedestrianization on air quality in different scenarios.",

        "abstract":"Information extracted from aerial photographs is widely used in the fields of urban planning and architecture. An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured 3D virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include thin clouds, which degrade image quality. In this research, the thin clouds in these aerial photographs are removed by using a generative adversarial network, which leads to improvements in training accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a method for automatically generating building mask images by using 3D virtual models with textured aerial photographs to enable the removable of thin clouds so that the image can be used for deep learning. A model trained on datasets generated by the proposed method was able to detect buildings in aerial photographs with an accuracy of IoU = 0.651.",

        "introduction":"Information extracted from aerial photographs is widely used in the fields of urban planning and architecture. An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured 3D virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include thin clouds, which degrade image quality.",

Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.",

Diverse kinds of control signals from massive systems and devices such as adaptive traffic light systems in smart cities can be collected and utilized. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect a massive dataset of control signals as doing so in the real-world requires significant effort and time. This paper proposes a deep generative model which integrates a long short-term memory model with generative adversarial network (LSTM-GAN) to generate agent control signals based on the words extracted from newspaper articles to solve the problem of collecting massive signals. The discriminatory network in the LSTM-GAN takes continuous word embedding vectors as inputs generated by a pre-trained Word2Vec model. The agent control signals of sequential actions are simultaneously predicted by the LSTM-GAN in real time. Specifically, to collect the training data of smart city simulations, the LSTM-GAN is trained based on the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) newspaper dataset, which contains 5,317,731 sentences, for a total of 93,626,203 word tokens, from written texts. To verify the proposed method, agent control signals were generated and validated. In the training of the LSTM-GAN, the accuracy of the discriminator converged to 50%. In addition, the losses of the discriminator and the generator converged from 4527.04 and 4527.94 to 2.97 and 1.87, respectively.",

Effective urban planning can help to mitigate the operational and social vulnerability of a urban system, such as high tax, crimes, traffic congestion and accidents, pollution, depression, and anxiety. Due to the high complexity of urban systems, such tasks are mostly completed by professional planners. But, human planners take longer time. The recent advance of deep learning motivates us to ask: can machines learn at a human capability to automatically and quickly calculate land-use configuration, so human planners can finally adjust machine-generated plans for specific needs? To this end, we formulate the automated urban planning problem into a task of learning to configure land-uses, given the surrounding spatial contexts. To set up the task, we define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor, where each channel is a category of POIs and the value of an entry is the number of POIs. The objective is then to propose an adversarial learning framework that can automatically generate such tensor for an unplanned area. In particular, we first characterize the contexts of surrounding areas of an unplanned area by learning representations from spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data. Second, we combine each unplanned area and its surrounding context representation as a tuple, and categorize all the tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Third, we develop an adversarial land-use configuration approach, where the surrounding context representation is fed into a generator to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish among positive and negative samples. Finally, we devise two new measurements to evaluate the quality of land-use configurations and present extensive experiment and visualization results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

This makes the tasks related to building reconstruction very challenging since in most cases it is difficult to recognize the type of roofs, especially if overlaid with trees. This work represents a continuation of research regarding the automatic optimization of building geometries in photogrammetric DSMs with half-meter resolution and introduces an improved generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture which allows to reconstruct complete and detailed building structures without neglecting even low-rise urban constructions. The generative part of the network is constructed in a way that it simultaneously processes height and intensity information, and combines short and long skip connections within one architecture. To improve different aspects of the surface, several loss terms are used, the contributions of which are automatically balanced during training. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve two goals without any manual intervention: improve the roof surfaces by making them more planar and also recognize and optimize even small residential buildings which are hard to detect.",

Our main contribution is twofold. Firstly, we added displacement attributes to the random walks to generate not only the sequence but also the spatial position of nodes as intersections within a road network to be generated, which increases the diversity of generated road network patterns including the shape of the city blocks. Secondly, we make the generator and discriminator neural networks conditional. This allows for learning of the specification of the initial node of random walks over a graph, which is especially important for interactive road network generation that is mostly used in the applications for urban planning of road networks. We demonstrate that the proposed method can generate road networks that mimic the real road networks with the desired similarity.",

The ever growing laser market will expand in the coming years, thanks to the development of automotive laser lighting, high-speed Li-Fi optical data transmission, LiDAR sensing for autonomous vehicles and smart cities, head-up displays, and AR\/VR systems, in addition to biomedical and further industrial applications. These emerging technologies demand for mass-production of GaN-based lasers to be produced on large-size, low-cost, and industrially compatible substrates. To address this issue, we demonstrate the first electrically injected semipolar 440 nm LD on high-quality and low-defect-density (11-22) GaN templates grown on scalable and low-cost sapphire substrates. The LDs exhibit a threshold current density of 17 kA\/cm2, a single facet output power of more than 200 mW at 2 A with a slope efficiency of 0.85 W\/A, and a TE polarization having a ratio of 97.6%. These results enable the advancement of ultra-low-cost LDs while benefiting from the inherent advantages of semipolar GaN properties.",

This paper aims to discover a mapping between live and dead phytoplankton. We propose PhytoGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network for the unpaired dead-tolive phytoplankton translation. We design a new PCALoss by extracting the principal component of the image to enhance the contour of the generated image. The addition of PCALoss can significantly improve the integrity of images. The experiments are carried out on the existing phytoplankton dataset. A series of experiments are discussed in the paper to demonstrate the performance of the domain transformation and the proposed loss functions. The experimental results indicate that PhytoGAN can produce more integral images of phytoplankton while completing the domain transformation compared with the existing methods.",

This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM.",
