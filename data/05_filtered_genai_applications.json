        "abstract":"Almost one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions are from buildings and nearly 70 % of energy is consumed in urban areas. To address this as a long-term issue, accurately predicting building energy use at the urban level is indispensable. Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is an emerging method to investigate urban design and energy systems at urban and neighborhood levels. UBEM methods are considered reasonably accurate in simulating the performance of almost any building combinations. However, customized urban projects, and optimization problems involving many UBEM scenarios, are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and based on the scalability, the simulation runtime can be exponentially high if a broad set of design variations is analyzed. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to generate a surrogate model for UBEM and accelerate the simulation process. Based on the extensively used forecasting model, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), we extract the static covariate encoder and variable selection network from the TFT structure while adding a small neural network to model the probability of triggering heating and cooling needs. The major advantages compared to other surrogate models are: (i) A sequential input in the transformer-based model to improve the temporal accuracy. (ii) A physics-inspired training strategy that builds on weather dynamics and urban interactions for hourly energy demands concurrently with a customized loss function. (iii) Improved generalizability for the proposed surrogate model using open and public data. In our study of 114 buildings in different climate zones in the US, our model predicts heating and cooling triggers in unseen climate dynamics with an F1 score of 0.83 while the root mean squared error (RMSE) of hourly loads was 71.51 kWh. This model is available for interfacing with climate projections and city-scale analysis as part of atmospheric urban digital twins.",

Comprehensive and historical, it complements the Brunei Darussalam Central Bank's Residential Property Price Index (RPPI), addressing the limitations of restricted access to raw RPPI data and its relatively short timeline since its inception in 2015. Data collection involved manual transcription from archival sources and automated web scraping using programmatic techniques, supported by innovative processing with Large Language Models (LLMs) to codify unstructured text. The data set enables spatial and temporal analysis, with potential applications in economics, urban planning, and real estate research. Although listing prices are only a proxy for market values and may deviate from actual sale prices due to negotiation dynamics and other factors, this data set still provides a valuable resource for quantitative analyses of housing market trends and for informing policy decisions.",

        "abstract":"Urban flooding presents a growing challenge in metropolitan areas due to climate change and increasing impervious surfaces. This research proposes a Green Infrastructure (GI) planning approach to enhance flood control and resilience in the flood-prone Yeoksam-dong region of Gangnam, Seoul, South Korea. A mixed-method approach was employed, incorporating both residents\u2019 preferences and hydrological simulations using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to assess the effectiveness of various GI controls. Key GI co-benefits were identified through importance\u2013performance analysis (IPA) and fuzzy weight rankings. Based on these, three GI scenarios were developed and evaluated for their flood mitigation potential. Scenario 1 (infiltration trench, rain garden, and rain barrel) emerged as the most effective, reducing surface runoff by 18.56 % and achieving the best cost-benefit ratio of 1.01 over a 10-year period. Scenario 2 (bio-retention, pervious pavement, and green roof), while less effective in terms of flood mitigation, may still offer ecological and social co-benefits. The study also conducted a sensitivity analysis, which confirmed Scenario 1\u2019s robustness across various levels of imperviousness, making it a highly adaptable solution for urban settings. This research highlights the importance of community engagement in GI planning and demonstrates how integrating hydrological performance with socioeconomic benefits can enhance urban resilience. By aligning with the 4Rs of resilience; robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners seeking cost-effective, scalable solutions for flood-prone areas. The findings underscore the value of multifunctional GI controls in not only reducing flood risks but also promoting long-term sustainability and community well-being.",

The RGB images provide spectral and texture details, DSMs offer structural and elevation context, and the building vector map enhances semantic consistency. This research advances building change detection by introducing a fully transformer-based model for end-to-end change detection, incorporating diverse geospatial data sources, and improving accuracy over traditional CNN-based methods.

Generating such 3D models from exemplars manually is time-consuming, while 3D deep learning approaches have high memory costs. In this paper, we present a technique for training 2D neural networks to repeatedly sculpt a plane into a large-scale 3D urban environment. An initial coarse depth map is created by a GAN model, from which we refine 3D normal and depth using an image translation network regularized by a linear system. The networks are trained using real-world data to allow generative synthesis of meshes at scale. We exploit sculpting from multiple viewpoints to generate a highly detailed, concave, and water-tight 3D mesh. We show cityscapes at scales of 100\u00d71600 meters with more than 2 million triangles, and demonstrate that our results are objectively and subjectively similar to our exemplars.",

        "abstract":"Objective Building change detection is an essential task in urban planning, disaster management, environmental monitoring, and other critical applications. Advances in multi-temporal remote sensing technology have provided vast amounts of data, enabling the monitoring of changes over large geographic areas and extended time frames. Despite this, significant challenges persist, particularly in acquiring sufficient labeled data pairs for training deep learning models. Building changes are typically characterized by long temporal cycles, leading to a scarcity of annotated data that is critical for training data-driven deep learning models. This scarcity severely limits the models\u2019 capacity to generalize and achieve high accuracy, particularly in complex and diverse scenarios. The performance of existing methods often suffers from poor generalization due to insufficient training data, reducing their applicability to practical tasks. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel solution: the development of a multi-temporal building change detection data pair generation network, referred to as BAG-GAN. This network leverages a consistency adversarial generation mechanism to create diverse and semantically consistent data pairs. The aim is to enrich training datasets, thereby enhancing the learning capacity of deep learning models for detecting building changes. By addressing the bottleneck of insufficient labeled data, BAG-GAN provides a new pathway for improving the accuracy and robustness of multi-temporal building change detection. Methods BAG-GAN integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with a specially designed consistency constraint mechanism, tailored for the generation of data pairs in multi-temporal building change detection tasks. The core innovation of this network lies in its adversarial consistency loss function. This loss function ensures that the generated images maintain semantic consistency with the corresponding input images while reflecting realistic and diverse changes. The consistency constraint is crucial for preserving the integrity of the generated data and ensuring its relevance to real-world scenarios. The network is composed of two main components: a generator and a discriminator, which work in tandem through an adversarial learning process. The generator aims to produce realistic and semantically consistent multi-temporal image pairs, while the discriminator evaluates the quality of the generated data, guiding the generator to improve iteratively. Additionally, BAG-GAN is equipped with multimodal output capabilities, enabling the generation of diverse building change data pairs. This diversity enhances the robustness of deep learning models by exposing them to a wider range of scenarios during training. To address the issue of limited training data, the study incorporates a data augmentation strategy. Original datasets, such as LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD, were reorganized by combining change labels with multi-temporal remote sensing images to create new synthetic datasets. These augmented datasets, along with the data generated by BAG-GAN, were used to train and evaluate several widely recognized deep learning models, including FC-EF, FC-Siam-Conc, and others. Comparative experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of BAG-GAN and its contribution to improving model performance in multi-temporal building change detection. Results and Discussions The experimental results demonstrate that BAG-GAN effectively addresses the challenges of insufficient labeled data in building change detection tasks. Models trained on the augmented datasets, which included BAG-GAN-generated data, achieved significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. For instance, classic models like FC-EF and FC-Siam-Conc showed substantial performance gains when trained on augmented datasets compared to their performance on the original datasets. These improvements validate the effectiveness of BAG-GAN in generating high-quality training data. BAG-GAN also excelled in producing diverse and multimodal building change data pairs visual comparisons between the generated data and the original datasets and highlighted the network\u2019s ability to create realistic and varied data, effectively enhancing the diversity of training datasets. This diversity is critical for addressing the imbalance in existing datasets, where effective building change information is underrepresented. By increasing the proportion of relevant change information in the training data, BAG-GAN improves the learning conditions for deep learning models, enabling them to better generalize across different scenarios. Further analysis revealed that BAG-GAN significantly enhances the ability of detection models to localize changes and recover fine-grained details of building modifications. This is particularly evident in complex scenarios involving subtle or small-scale changes. The adversarial consistency loss function played a pivotal role in ensuring the semantic relevance of the generated data, making BAG-GAN a reliable tool for data augmentation in remote sensing applications. Moreover, the network\u2019s ability to generate data pairs with high-quality and multimodal characteristics ensures its applicability to a wide range of remote sensing tasks beyond building change detection. Conclusions This study introduces BAG-GAN, a novel multi-temporal building change detection data pair generation network designed to overcome the limitations of insufficient labeled data in remote sensing. The network incorporates an adversarial consistency loss function, which ensures that the generated data is both semantically consistent and diverse. By leveraging a consistency adversarial generation mechanism, BAG-GAN enhances the quality and diversity of training datasets, addressing key bottlenecks in multi-temporal building change detection tasks. Through experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets, BAG-GAN demonstrated its ability to significantly improve the performance of classic remote sensing change detection models, such as FC-EF and FC-Siam-Conc. The results highlight the network\u2019s effectiveness in generating high-quality data pairs that enhance model training and detection accuracy. This research not only provides a robust methodological framework for improving multi-temporal building change detection but also offers a foundational tool for broader applications in remote sensing.

        "contribution":"This paper addresses the issues of data insufficiency and imbalanced sample distribution in AMR technology by constructing a simulated water meter digit generator that automatically generates water meter data images and their corresponding label files. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of semi-character recognition, the model\u2019s learning capability is enhanced by increasing the semi-character data samples and introducing auxiliary features. Finally, a counting area extraction method that combines object detection algorithms with perspective transformation techniques is introduced into the existing AMR framework, effectively resolving problems related to image skew correction and perspective distortion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the original dataset, training with the enhanced dataset proposed in this paper significantly improves the model\u2019s performance in recognizing water meter digits, particularly showing advantages in semi-character recognition, thereby providing new insights and solutions for the development of AMR technology.",

However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study.

Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis.

        "abstract":"Highlights: What are the main findings? Smart Cities as Hyper-Connected Digital Environments generate large and diverse data streams and repositories that do not consistently translate into insights and decisions. A Responsible AI Hyper-Automation framework with Generative AI agents is developed and evaluated to address these complex challenges. What are the implications of the main findings? The developed AI framework is effective when grounded on five core technical capabilities with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automated agentic AI that feeds into human-in-the-loop processes. The framework provides a prototypical setting for university cities of the future to provide direction, guidance, and standards for sustainable and safe smart cities of the future. Smart cities are Hyper-Connected Digital Environments (HCDEs) that transcend the boundaries of natural, human-made, social, virtual, and artificial environments. Human activities are no longer confined to a single environment as our presence and interactions are represented and interconnected across HCDEs. The data streams and repositories of HCDEs provide opportunities for the responsible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that generates unique insights into the constituent environments and the interplay across constituents. The translation of data into insights poses several complex challenges originating in data generation and then propagating through the computational layers to decision outcomes. To address these challenges, this article presents the design and development of a Hyper-Automated AI framework with Generative AI agents for sustainable smart cities. The framework is empirically evaluated in the living lab setting of a \u2018University City of the Future\u2019. The developed AI framework is grounded on the core capabilities of acquisition, preparation, orchestration, dissemination, and retrospection, with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automation of these AI capabilities using Generative AI. Hyper-automation output feeds into a human-in-the-loop process prior to decision-making outcomes. More broadly, this framework aims to provide a validated pathway for university cities of the future to take up the role of prototypes that deliver evidence-based guidelines for the development and management of sustainable smart cities.",

Smart Cities as Hyper-Connected Digital Environments generate large and diverse data streams and repositories that do not consistently translate into insights and decisions. A Responsible AI Hyper-Automation framework with Generative AI agents is developed and evaluated to address these complex challenges. What are the implications of the main findings? The developed AI framework is effective when grounded on five core technical capabilities with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automated agentic AI that feeds into human-in-the-loop processes. The framework provides a prototypical setting for university cities of the future to provide direction, guidance, and standards for sustainable and safe smart cities of the future. Smart cities are Hyper-Connected Digital Environments (HCDEs) that transcend the boundaries of natural, human-made, social, virtual, and artificial environments. Human activities are no longer confined to a single environment as our presence and interactions are represented and interconnected across HCDEs. The data streams and repositories of HCDEs provide opportunities for the responsible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that generates unique insights into the constituent environments and the interplay across constituents. The translation of data into insights poses several complex challenges originating in data generation and then propagating through the computational layers to decision outcomes.",
        "contribution":"To address these challenges, this article presents the design and development of a Hyper-Automated AI framework with Generative AI agents for sustainable smart cities. The framework is empirically evaluated in the living lab setting of a \u2018University City of the Future\u2019. The developed AI framework is grounded on the core capabilities of acquisition, preparation, orchestration, dissemination, and retrospection, with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automation of these AI capabilities using Generative AI. Hyper-automation output feeds into a human-in-the-loop process prior to decision-making outcomes. More broadly, this framework aims to provide a validated pathway for university cities of the future to take up the role of prototypes that deliver evidence-based guidelines for the development and management of sustainable smart cities.",

        "abstract":"The use of synthetic populations has grown considerably over the recent years, in revolutionizing studies conducted within various fields, including social science research, urban planning, public health and transportation modeling. These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and\/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners. This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals.

Herein, we developed a rapid urban traffic noise mapping technique that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a surrogate model. This approach enables the rapid assessment of urban traffic noise distribution by using urban elements such as roads and buildings as the input.

Traditional cyber security measures, designed for a less dynamic threat landscape, are proving increasingly insufficient in protecting against the innovative and varied attack methods now in commonplace. This study introduces an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address this challenge, presenting a novel framework for the simulation and mitigation of advanced network attacks, particularly focusing on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and spoofing attacks which pose significant threats in IoT environments.

The study introduces a cascade adversarial strategy based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), optimised explicitly for sparse observation trajectories.

        "abstract":"Change detection (CD) is an important research direction in the field of remote sensing, which aims to analyze the changes in the same area over different periods and is widely used in urban planning and environmental protection. While supervised learning methods in change detection have demonstrated substantial efficacy, they are often hindered by the rising costs associated with data annotation. Semi-supervised methods have attracted increasing interest, offering promising results with limited data labeling. These approaches typically employ strategies such as consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, and generative adversarial networks. However, they usually face the problems of insufficient data augmentation and unbalanced quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling. To address the above problems, we propose a semi-supervised change detection method with data augmentation and adaptive threshold updating (DA-AT) for high-resolution remote sensing images. Firstly, a channel-level data augmentation (CLDA) technique is designed to enhance the strong augmentation effect and improve consistency regularization so as to address the problem of insufficient feature representation. Secondly, an adaptive threshold (AT) is proposed to dynamically adjust the threshold during the training process to balance the quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling so as to optimize the self-training process. Finally, an adaptive class weight (ACW) mechanism is proposed to alleviate the impact of the imbalance between the changed classes and the unchanged classes, which effectively enhances the learning ability of the model for the changed classes. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on two high-resolution remote sensing image datasets, WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD. We compare our method to five state-of-the-art change detection methods and show that it achieves better or comparable results.",

While supervised learning methods in change detection have demonstrated substantial efficacy, they are often hindered by the rising costs associated with data annotation. Semi-supervised methods have attracted increasing interest, offering promising results with limited data labeling. These approaches typically employ strategies such as consistency regularization, pseudo-labeling, and generative adversarial networks. However, they usually face the problems of insufficient data augmentation and unbalanced quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling.",
        "contribution":"To address the above problems, we propose a semi-supervised change detection method with data augmentation and adaptive threshold updating (DA-AT) for high-resolution remote sensing images. Firstly, a channel-level data augmentation (CLDA) technique is designed to enhance the strong augmentation effect and improve consistency regularization so as to address the problem of insufficient feature representation. Secondly, an adaptive threshold (AT) is proposed to dynamically adjust the threshold during the training process to balance the quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling so as to optimize the self-training process. Finally, an adaptive class weight (ACW) mechanism is proposed to alleviate the impact of the imbalance between the changed classes and the unchanged classes, which effectively enhances the learning ability of the model for the changed classes. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on two high-resolution remote sensing image datasets, WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD. We compare our method to five state-of-the-art change detection methods and show that it achieves better or comparable results.",

        "abstract":"With the development and widespread application of network information, new technologies led by 5G are emerging, resulting in an increasingly complex network security environment and more diverse attack methods. Unlike traditional networks, 5G networks feature higher connection density, faster data transmission speeds, and lower latency, which are widely applied in scenarios such as smart cities, the Internet of Things, and autonomous driving. The vast amounts of sensitive data generated by these applications become primary targets during the processes of collection and secure sharing, and unauthorized access or tampering could lead to severe data breaches and integrity issues. However, as 5G networks extensively employ encryption technologies to protect data transmission, attackers can hide malicious content within encrypted communication, rendering traditional content-based traffic detection methods ineffective for identifying malicious encrypted traffic. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a malicious encrypted traffic detection method based on reconstructive domain adaptation and adversarial hybrid neural networks. The proposed method integrates generative adversarial networks with ResNet, ResNeXt, and DenseNet to construct an adversarial hybrid neural network, aiming to tackle the challenges of encrypted traffic detection. On this basis, a reconstructive domain adaptation module is introduced to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain, thereby enhancing cross-domain detection capabilities. By preprocessing traffic data from public datasets, the proposed method is capable of extracting deep features from encrypted traffic without the need for decryption. The generator utilizes the adversarial hybrid neural network module to generate realistic malicious encrypted traffic samples, while the discriminator achieves sample classification through high-dimensional feature extraction. Additionally, the domain classifier within the reconstructive domain adaptation module further improves the model\u2019s stability and generalization across different network environments and time periods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of malicious encrypted traffic detection in 5G network environments, effectively enhancing the detection performance of malicious traffic in 5G networks.",

However, a key challenge in WSNs is the short lifespan of sensor nodes (SN), as continuous sensing leads to rapid battery depletion. In high-traffic areas, sensors located near the sink node exhaust their energy quickly, creating an energy-hole issue. As a result, optimizing energy usage is a significant challenge for WSN-assisted applications. To address this, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Routing and Cluster Head Selection in Wireless Sensor Network through an Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network for Golden Search Optimization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Network (EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA). This method involves selecting the Cluster Head (CH) using Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network (ADRGAN), minimizing energy consumption, and reducing a number of dead sensor nodes. Subsequently, Golden Search Optimization Algorithm (GSOA) is employed to determine an optimal path for data transmission to the sink node, maximizing energy efficiency, and elongating sensor node lifespan. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA method is simulated in MATLAB. The performance metrics, such as network lifetime, number of alive nodes, number of dead nodes, throughput, energy consumption, and packet delivery ratio is examined. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA demonstrates improved performance, achieving a higher average throughput of 0.93 Mbps, and lower average energy consumption of 0.39 mJ compared with the existing methods.

Experiment results show that compared to the baselines, trajectories generated by our method have closer data distributions to the real ones. We argued that the designs of spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced generation tasks and training loss benefit the spatiotemporal generation processes, which help reproduce the temporal patterns of human daily activities and spatial distribution of human movements.",

By leveraging Geographic Information System (GIS) metadata, the method transforms natural language queries into precise SQL queries, enhancing the functionality of LLMs in geospatial database management.

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce richly descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. However, most current RSIC models generally apply only fine-tuning to these datasets without developing models tailored to the unique characteristics of remote sensing imagery. This article proposes RS-MoE, the first mixture of expert (MoE)-based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE block, which incorporates a novel instruction router and multiple lightweight large language models (LLMs) as expert models. The instruction router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of subtasks. In addition, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design.

While existing PCPM methods have successfully identified co-location patterns, they often generate a significant amount of redundant patterns, which hinders both computational efficiency and interpretability. To address these challenges, we present MTRM (Multi-Threshold Redundancy Mitigation), a novel framework designed to mitigate redundancy through the introduction of multiple thresholds. MTRM allows for the flexible adjustment of significance levels, enabling the discovery of more concise and meaningful co-location patterns. Unlike traditional single-threshold methods, our approach dynamically filters out redundant patterns, retaining only those that exhibit strong spatial relationships across multiple criteria. MTRM is implemented as a web-based miner, providing users with a real-time, interactive platform to analyze spatial datasets. The flexibility of MTRM allows it to handle datasets of varying sizes and complexities, making it suitable for both real-world applications and large-scale synthetic data experiments. We benchmark the performance of MTRM against several state-of-the-art PCPM algorithms, demonstrating its ability to reduce redundancy while maintaining high accuracy in pattern discovery. Experimental results show that MTRM not only enhances scalability and efficiency but also improves the quality of discovered patterns by reducing noise and redundancy, leading to more actionable insights for decision-makers in fields such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and epidemiology.",

Effectively addressing this spatial complexity necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, as unified methodologies may prove insufficient. Specifically, in urban planning, it is increasingly crucial to prioritize bike lanes, bike stations, and pedestrian zones, for functional transportation infrastructures. This approach can enhance cities by improving air quality, reducing emissions, and boosting public health and safety through physical activity and accident prevention.

This paper proposes a hybrid model for identifying optimal locations for bike lanes, bike stations, and pedestrian zones adopting Real-Time Spatial Delphi and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Real-Time Spatial Delphi is a modified version of the traditional Delphi method that incorporates real-time feedback and visualization of group response in real-time, aiming to achieve a convergence of opinions among experts on the territory. Nevertheless, these judgments are a spatial representation not visible in reality, and with the spread of artificial intelligence models, different implementations can support the planning process, such as the use of GANs. In this case, GANs can be exploited by adopting pre-existing location images resulting from experts\u2019 judgments to illustrate the proposed intervention\u2019s visual impact.

In this case, GANs can be exploited by adopting pre-existing location images resulting from experts\u2019 judgments to illustrate the proposed intervention\u2019s visual impact. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid model, we apply it to the city of Dublin. The results showcased how the method helps stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens in visualizing the proposed changes and gauging their potential impact with greater precision.",

In this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs.

While there are numerous qualitative studies on the relationship between child-friendliness and various indicators of urban vitality, quantitative research remains relatively scarce, leading to a lack of sufficient objective and trustworthy data to guide urban planning and the development of child-friendly cities. This paper presents an analytical framework, using Heping District in Tianjin, China, as a case study. It defines four main indicators\u2014social vitality, environmental vitality, spatial vitality, and urban scene perception\u2014for a trustworthy and transparent quantitative evaluation. The study integrates multi-source data, including primary education (POI) data, street view image (SVI) data, spatiotemporal big data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and large visual language models (LVLMs) for the trustworthy analysis. These data are visualized using corresponding big data and weighted analysis methods, ensuring transparent and accurate assessments of the child-friendliness of urban blocks. This research introduces an innovative and trustworthy method for evaluating the child-friendliness of urban blocks, addressing gaps in the quantitative theory of child-friendliness in urban planning. It also provides a practical and reliable tool for urban planners, offering a solid theoretical foundation to create environments that better meet the needs of children in a trustworthy manner.",

While there are numerous qualitative studies on the relationship between child-friendliness and various indicators of urban vitality, quantitative research remains relatively scarce, leading to a lack of sufficient objective and trustworthy data to guide urban planning and the development of child-friendly cities.",
        "contribution":"This paper presents an analytical framework, using Heping District in Tianjin, China, as a case study. It defines four main indicators\u2014social vitality, environmental vitality, spatial vitality, and urban scene perception\u2014for a trustworthy and transparent quantitative evaluation. The study integrates multi-source data, including primary education (POI) data, street view image (SVI) data, spatiotemporal big data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and large visual language models (LVLMs) for the trustworthy analysis. These data are visualized using corresponding big data and weighted analysis methods, ensuring transparent and accurate assessments of the child-friendliness of urban blocks. This research introduces an innovative and trustworthy method for evaluating the child-friendliness of urban blocks, addressing gaps in the quantitative theory of child-friendliness in urban planning. It also provides a practical and reliable tool for urban planners, offering a solid theoretical foundation to create environments that better meet the needs of children in a trustworthy manner.",

Earthquake simulation can be considered as a complex system. Traditional simulation methods, which primarily focus on computing intricate factors for single buildings or simplified architectural agglomerations, often fall short in providing realistic visuals and real-time structural damage assessments for urban environments. To address this deficiency, we introduce a real-time, high visual fidelity earthquake simulation platform based on the Chaos Physics System in Unreal Engine, specifically designed to simulate the damage to urban buildings. Initially, we use a genetic algorithm to calibrate material simulation parameters from Ansys into the Unreal Engine's fracture system, based on real-world test standards. This alignment ensures the similarity of results between the two systems while achieving real-time capabilities. Additionally, by integrating real earthquake waveform data, we improve the simulation's authenticity, ensuring it accurately reflects historical events. All functionalities are integrated into a visual user interface, enabling zero-code operation, which facilitates testing and further development by cross-disciplinary users. We verify the platform's effectiveness through three AI-based tasks: similarity detection, path planning, and image segmentation.

The Mask R-CNN-based method efficiently processes and classifies the features of the dataset, generating candidate regions for further analysis. Additionally, this method demonstrates significant advantages in building feature extraction by employing the Mask R-CNN model to generate adaptive features. Comparative analysis with models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Fast R-CNN), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) indicates that Mask R-CNN exhibits superior performance in building feature extraction. The Mask R-CNN-based approach achieved approximately 95 % classification accuracy, while also showcasing strong stability and generalization capabilities. This study provides new methodologies and insights for enhancing feature extraction in aerial building imagery, offering significant reference value for the fields of architectural design and urban planning.",

Given the large size, complex target features, and abundant details of remote sensing images, along with the need for efficient information acquisition, we propose a Diffusion Super-Resolution (DSR) algorithm based on a conditional diffusion model.

        "abstract":"Procedural modeling offers significant advantages over traditional methods of geovisualizing 3D building models, particularly in its use of scripts or machine language for model description. This approach is highly suitable for computer processing and allows for the rapid rendering of entire building models and cities, especially when the buildings are not highly diverse, thus fully leveraging the strengths of procedural modeling. The first hypothesis is that buildings in the real world are mostly different and they should still be able to be displayed through procedural modeling procedures, and the second hypothesis is that this can be achieved in several ways. The first hypothesis suggests that real-world buildings, despite their diversity, can still be effectively represented through procedural modeling. The second hypothesis explores various methods to achieve this representation. The first approach involves recognizing the basic characteristics of a building from photographs and creating a model using machine learning. The second approach utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate detailed building models based on comprehensive input data. A script is generated for each building, making reverse procedural modeling in combination with AI an intriguing field of study, which is explored in this research. To validate this method, we compare AI-generated building models with manually derived models created through traditional procedural modeling techniques. The research demonstrates that integrating AI and machine learning techniques with procedural modeling significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of generating 3D building models. Specifically, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-to-geometry translation, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture generation, showed promising results in creating detailed and realistic 3D structures. This research is significant as it introduces a novel methodology that bridges the gap between traditional procedural modeling and modern AI-driven techniques. It offers a robust solution for automated 3D building modeling, potentially revolutionizing the fields of urban planning and architectural design by enabling more efficient and accurate digital representations of complex building geometries.",

The second hypothesis explores various methods to achieve this representation. The first approach involves recognizing the basic characteristics of a building from photographs and creating a model using machine learning. The second approach utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate detailed building models based on comprehensive input data. A script is generated for each building, making reverse procedural modeling in combination with AI an intriguing field of study, which is explored in this research. To validate this method, we compare AI-generated building models with manually derived models created through traditional procedural modeling techniques. The research demonstrates that integrating AI and machine learning techniques with procedural modeling significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of generating 3D building models. Specifically, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-to-geometry translation, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture generation, showed promising results in creating detailed and realistic 3D structures. This research is significant as it introduces a novel methodology that bridges the gap between traditional procedural modeling and modern AI-driven techniques. It offers a robust solution for automated 3D building modeling, potentially revolutionizing the fields of urban planning and architectural design by enabling more efficient and accurate digital representations of complex building geometries.",

Current road networks, especially in large cities, face acute pressures due to increased demand for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Although much attention has been given to improve traffic management and accommodate the increased demand via coordinating and optimizing traffic signals, research focused on adapting the static allocation of street spaces and right-of-way dynamically based on mixed traffic flow is still scarce. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) agent approach that cooperatively adapts the individual lane widths and right-of-way access permissions based on real-world mixed traffic flow. In particular, multiple cooperative agents are trained with mixed temporal data that learn to decide suitable lane widths for motorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, along with whether co-sharing space between pedestrians and cyclists is safe. Using a microscopic traffic simulator model of a four-legged intersection, we trained our RL agent on synthetic data, and tested it on realistic multi-modal traffic data. The proposed approach reduces the overall average waiting time and queue length by 48.9% and 37.7%, respectively, compared to the Static (baseline) street design. Additionally, we observe CALM's ability to gradually adjust lane widths, contrasting with the Heuristic implementation's erratic lane adjustments, which pose potential safety concerns. Notably, the model learns to adaptively toggle the co-sharing of street space between cyclists and pedestrians as one co-shared lane, ensuring comfort and maintaining the level of service according to the designer's policy.

        "abstract":"To evaluate the seasonal changes in quality and quantity of river Rispana (a tributary of river Ganges\u2014Dehradun region of India) water quality index (WQI) was calculated at four major locations by using the weighted arithmetic method. Sixteen samples in all were taken throughout the pre-monsoon (April 2022), monsoon (July 2022), post-monsoon (November 2022), and the Winter season (January 2023). The major parameters, namely, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS), E-coliform, sulphate, total alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were considered for calculation of WQI. The WQI varied from minimum 44.53 (good) at site 1 \u2013 Kairwaan Gaon during monsoon season to maximum 302.69 (unfit for drinking) at site 4 \u2013 Mothrowala during the pre-monsoon period. In 75% samples quality of water was unfit for domestic purpose and the contributing factors are DO, BOD, and Coliform which exceeds permissible limit in all samples. The major factors attributed for decline in the Rispana water quality are discharge of sewage, commercial sites effluent, and urban runoff. Pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter had average total coliform levels of 1849.6, 2419.6, 2419.6, and 1546.25, respectively, in MPN units. The average value of E-coli for the four season vary from 1306.8 to 1888.1 MPN. The pollution load (physico-chemical parameters and bacteriological factors) increases as the river Rispana flows to downstream in urban locations. Streamflow was observed as very lean except monsoon season (~1500 cfs) due to more extraction of Rispana's fresh water in upstream and unplanned changes in its catchment basin; thus establishes an extensive decline in availability of fresh water sources (Domestic use) in downstream Dehradun city area. In monsoon season, more streamflow (rain water influx) maintains the WQI also in good-moderate category.

In this paper, we target a new task called function-aware urban layout regeneration, and propose UrbanEvolver, a function-aware deep generative model for the task. Given a target region to be regenerated, our model outputs a regenerated urban layout (i.e., roads and buildings) for the target region by considering the function (i.e., land use type) of the target region and its surrounding context (i.e., the functions and urban layouts of the surrounding regions). UrbanEvolver first extracts implicit regeneration rules from the target function and the surrounding context by encoding them separately in different scales through the function-layout adaptive (FA) blocks, and then constrains the regenerated urban layout based on the learned regeneration rules. To enforce the regenerated layout to be valid and to follow the road structure, we design a set of losses covering both pixel-level and geometry-level constraints. To train our model, we collect a large-scale urban layout dataset covering more than 147 K regions under 1300 km2 with rich annotations, including functions, region shapes, urban road layouts, and urban building layouts.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model.

Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. In certain cases, it becomes challenging to collect any labeled data from downstream scenarios, intensifying the problem further. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model that can exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios.

This dataset includes the SpaceNet 6 Road (SN6R) dataset, derived from high-resolution SAR images and OSM road data, as well as the DG-SAR and SN3-SAR datasets, synthesized from existing EO datasets. We adapt an off-the-shelf road segmentation network from the optical to the SAR domain through an enhanced training framework that integrates both real and synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that the HybridSAR Road Dataset and the adapted network significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of SAR road segmentation, paving the way for future advancements in remote sensing.",

The impeding presence of urban buildings often affects the runout behavior and deposition of debris flows. But the impact of different building densities and sizes on debris flow dynamics has yet to be quantified to guide urban planning in debris flow risk zones. This study focused on a debris flow that occurred in Zhouqu County, Gansu Province, China on August 7th, 2010, which was catastrophic and destroyed many buildings. The FLO-2D software was used to simulate this debris flow in two scenarios, i.e. the presence and the absence of buildings, to obtain debris-flow intensity parameters. The developed model was then used to further analyze the influence of large buildings and narrow channels within the urban environment. The simulation results show that considering the presence of buildings in the simulation is essential for accurate assessment of debris flow intensity and deposition distribution. The layout of buildings in the upstream urban area, such as large buildings or parallel buildings which form narrow channels, can affect the flow velocity and depth of debris flow heading towards downstream buildings. To mitigate damage to downstream buildings, the relative spacing (d\/a) between upstream and downstream buildings should not exceed a value of two and should ideally be even lower.

        "abstract":"As cities transform, disrupting citizens' lives, their participation in urban development is often undervalued despite its importance. Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes. The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources. The results show that contextual feedback performed better overall, with significant improvements in the pragmatic and hedonic quality, attractiveness, reuse intention, feeling that the complaint is taken seriously, and the citizens' trust in their municipality.",

        "introduction":"As cities transform, disrupting citizens' lives, their participation in urban development is often undervalued despite its importance. Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes.",
        "contribution":"The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality.

        "abstract":"In the Department of Choc\u00f3, flooding poses a recurrent and significant challenge due to heavy rainfall and the dense network of rivers characterizing the region. However, the lack of adequate infrastructure to prevent and predict floods exacerbates this situation. The absence of early warning systems, the scarcity of meteorological and hydrological monitoring stations, and deficiencies in urban planning contribute to the vulnerability of communities to these phenomena. It is imperative to invest in flood prediction and prevention infrastructure, including advanced monitoring systems, the development of hydrological prediction models, and the construction of hydraulic infrastructure, to reduce risk and protect vulnerable communities in Choc\u00f3. Additionally, raising public awareness of the associated risks and encouraging the adoption of mitigation and preparedness measures throughout the population are essential. This study introduces a novel approach for the multivariate prediction of hydrological variables, specifically focusing on water level forecasts for two hydrological stations along the Atrato River in Colombia. The model, utilizing a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, integrates data from hydrological variables, such as the flow, precipitation, and level. With a model architecture featuring four inputs and two outputs, where flow and precipitation serve as inputs and the level serves as the output for each station, the LSTM model is adept at capturing the complex dynamics and cross-correlations among these variables. Validation involves comparing the LSTM model\u2019s performance with linear and nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) models, considering factors such as the estimation error and computational time. Furthermore, this study explores different scenarios for water level prediction, aiming to utilize the proposed approach as an effective flood early warning system.",

This study introduces the masked-attention mask transformer (Mask2Former), based on the Swin Transformer, for building footprint extraction from large-scale satellite imagery. To enhance the capture of large-scale semantic information and extract multiscale features, a hierarchical vision transformer with shifted windows (Swin Transformer) serves as the backbone network. An extensive analysis compares the efficiency and generalizability of Mask2Former with four CNN models (PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, UpperNet-ConvNext, and SegNeXt) and two transformer-based models (UpperNet-Swin and SegFormer) featuring different complexities. Results reveal superior performance of transformer-based models over CNN-based counterparts, showcasing exceptional generalization across diverse testing areas with varying building structures, heights, and sizes.

        "abstract":"A smarter city should be a safer city. Nighttime safety in metropolitan areas has long been a global concern, particularly for large cities with diverse demographics and intricate urban forms, whose citizens are often threatened by higher street-level crime rates. However, due to the lack of night-time urban appearance data, prior studies based on street view imagery (SVI) rarely addressed the perceived night-time safety issue, which can generate important implications for crime prevention. This study hypothesizes that night-time SVI can be effectively generated from widely existing daytime SVIs using generative AI (GenAI). To test the hypothesis, this study first collects pairwise day-and-night SVIs across four cities diverged in urban landscapes to construct a comprehensive day-and-night SVI dataset. It then trains and validates a day-to-night (D2N) model with fine-tuned brightness adjustment, effectively transforming daytime SVIs to nighttime ones for distinct urban forms tailored for urban scene perception studies. Our findings indicate that: (1) the performance of D2N transformation varies significantly by urban-scape variations related to urban density; (2) the proportion of building and sky views are important determinants of transformation accuracy; (3) within prevailed models, CycleGAN maintains the consistency of D2N scene conversion, but requires abundant data. Pix2Pix achieves considerable accuracy when pairwise day\u2013and\u2013night-night SVIs are available and are sensitive to data quality. StableDiffusion yields high-quality images with expensive training costs. Therefore, CycleGAN is most effective in balancing the accuracy, data requirement, and cost. This study contributes to urban scene studies by constructing a first-of-its-kind D2N dataset consisting of pairwise day-and-night SVIs across various urban forms. The D2N generator will provide a cornerstone for future urban studies that heavily utilize SVIs to audit urban environments.",

        "abstract":"In recent years, the application of the internet of things (IoT) in areas such as intelligent transportation, smart cities, and the industrial internet has become increasingly widespread. As a crucial supporting infrastructure, IoT devices are utilized in various fields to construct IoT networks. However, due to the inherent limitations of IoT devices, such as limited computing resources and low memory capacity, security concerns have become increasingly prominent. Among these concerns are Denial-of-Service (DoS) and botnet attacks, which are difficult to prevent due to their large-scale and covert nature. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid DoS Attack Intrusion Detection System (HDA-IDS) that combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to effectively identify both known and unknown DoS\/botnet attacks. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel anomaly-based detection model called CL-GAN. It integrates CNN-LSTM with GAN to establish a baseline for normal behavior and detect malicious traffic. In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in addressing security issues in IoT networks, and presents a general framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale attacks constructed through the dissemination of false information.",

This paper proposes an early fire detection system optimized for certain spaces using a digital-twin-based automatic fire learning data generation model for each space. The proposed method first automatically generates realistic particle-simulation-based synthetic fire data on an RGB-D image matched to the view angle of a monitoring camera to build a digital twin environment of the real space. In other words, our method generates synthetic fire data according to various fire situations in each specific space and then performs transfer learning using a state-of-the-art detection model with these datasets and distributes them to AIoT devices in the real space. Synthetic fire data generation optimized for a space can increase the accuracy and reduce the false detection rate of existing fire detection models that are not adaptive to space.",

The proposed method first automatically generates realistic particle-simulation-based synthetic fire data on an RGB-D image matched to the view angle of a monitoring camera to build a digital twin environment of the real space. In other words, our method generates synthetic fire data according to various fire situations in each specific space and then performs transfer learning using a state-of-the-art detection model with these datasets and distributes them to AIoT devices in the real space. Synthetic fire data generation optimized for a space can increase the accuracy and reduce the false detection rate of existing fire detection models that are not adaptive to space.",

CNN is a commonly employed method that automates the extraction of features and the classification process. We employed CNN for feature extraction and traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. In this work, honest data were obtained from a real dataset. Six attack vectors causing data tampering were utilized. Tampered data were synthetically generated through these attack vectors. Six separate datasets were created for each attack vector to design a specialized detector tailored for that specific attack. Additionally, a dataset containing all attack vectors was also generated for the purpose of designing a general detector. Furthermore, the imbalanced dataset problem was addressed through the application of the generative adversarial network (GAN) method. GAN was chosen due to its ability to generate new data closely resembling real data, and its application in this field has not been extensively explored.

        "abstract":"City modeling and generation have attracted an increased interest in various applications, including gaming, urban planning, and autonomous driving. Unlike previous works focused on the generation of single objects or indoor scenes, the huge volumes of spatial data in cities pose a challenge to the generative models. Furthermore, few publicly available 3D real-world city datasets also hinder the development of methods for city generation. In this paper, we first collect over 3,000,000 geo-referenced objects for the cities of New York, Zurich, Tokyo, Berlin, Boston, and several other large cities. Based on this dataset, we propose AETree, a tree-structured auto-encoder neural network, for city generation. Specifically, we first propose a novel Spatial-Geometric Distance (SGD) metric to measure the similarity between building layouts and then construct a binary tree over the raw geometric data of the building based on the SGD metric. Next, we present a tree-structured network whose encoder learns to extract and merge spatial information from the bottom-up iteratively. The resulting global representation is reversely decoded for reconstruction or generation. To address the issue of long-dependency as the level of the tree increases, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Cell is employed as a basic network element of the proposed AETree. Moreover, we introduce a novel metric, Overlapping Area Ratio (OAR), to quantitatively evaluate the generation results. Experiments on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline models, such as LayoutTransformer and LayoutVAE, in terms of key metrics. Specifically, the proposed model achieves a Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence (JSD) of 0.0033, compared to 0.0041 and 0.0061 for LayoutTransformer and LayoutVAE, respectively. Similarly, for the Overall Accuracy Rate (OAR), the proposed model scores 1.66, significantly better than 28.24 and 19.01 for the baseline models Furthermore, the latent features learned by AETree can serve downstream urban planning applications.

Using a structured narrative review method with a critical approach, the study highlights AI\u2019s versatility in analyzing complex social phenomena, understanding human behavior, and optimizing urban infrastructure. With its unique socio-cultural challenges, Saudi Arabia aims for sustainable development through Saudi Vision 2030 and various smart city projects, emphasizing the importance of addressing challenges like gender equality, cultural preservation, an increasing youth population, rapid urbanization, and climate change. The study identifies ten AI applications and models to address these challenges and promote relevant SDGs across six areas: Predictive Analytics and Forecasting, Optimization and Decision Support, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Geospatial AI. These AI models can help address issues like gender equality, youth education, and employment, as well as optimize water management, energy use, and urban planning to address rapid urbanization and climate change challenges. By aligning AI development with the goals outlined in the SDGs, Saudi Arabia can unlock the potential of AI to create sustainable, resilient, and inclusive smart cities that effectively address socio-cultural challenges. However, the study emphasizes the necessity of customizing AI applications in smart cities based on Saudi Arabia\u2019s religious and cultural values to ensure ethical and culturally sensitive implementations. The findings of this study hold relevance not only for Saudi Arabia but also for other countries facing similar challenges.

However, the complexity of urban environments poses significant challenges for effective planning and implementation. This paper presents an AI-driven framework to optimize urban and vertical agriculture planning by leveraging advanced machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), and Large Language Models (LLM). The proposed framework integrates diverse dataset that includes as socioeconomic data, geographic information, and urban zoning regulations to provide actionable insights for decision-makers. The Spiking Neural Network model demon-strated superior predictive accuracy in identifying optimal sites for urban agriculture by effectively handling complex patterns and temporal dynamics in the data. Additionally, the integration of an LLM-powered chatbot into a user-friendly web application enhances interactivity and supports real-time decision-making, guiding users through the prediction process with context-specific recommendations. Experimental results validate the robustness and scalability of the framework across various urban settings, demonstrating its potential to transform urban agriculture practices by providing precise, data-driven recommendations. The findings of this study highlight the transformative potential of AI in urban planning and agriculture, offering a novel approach to fostering sustainable urban development and food security. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset, refining model performance, and enhancing the application's capabilities to support more complex user queries.",

The Spiking Neural Network model demon-strated superior predictive accuracy in identifying optimal sites for urban agriculture by effectively handling complex patterns and temporal dynamics in the data. Additionally, the integration of an LLM-powered chatbot into a user-friendly web application enhances interactivity and supports real-time decision-making, guiding users through the prediction process with context-specific recommendations. Experimental results validate the robustness and scalability of the framework across various urban settings, demonstrating its potential to transform urban agriculture practices by providing precise, data-driven recommendations. The findings of this study highlight the transformative potential of AI in urban planning and agriculture, offering a novel approach to fostering sustainable urban development and food security. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset, refining model performance, and enhancing the application's capabilities to support more complex user queries.",

This paper presents a comprehensive study of three state-of-the-art approaches for image caption generation, employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers. The first approach utilises a CNN-LSTM architecture, where the CNN acts as an encoder to extract meaningful visual features from input images. These features are then fed into an LSTM-based decoder, enabling the generation of descriptive captions. The second approach introduces the use of attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on specific regions of the image while generating captions. This technique improves the caption quality and ensures that the generated text corresponds more accurately to the content in the image. Lastly, the third approach incorporates the powerful transformer architecture to capture long-range dependencies in the generated captions, enabling better contextual understanding and coherence.",

Traditional methods, such as face-based and fingerprint-based authentication, usually incur high costs to be installed in all this kind of environments. In this paper, we develop a ubiquitous low-effort user authentication approach, mmPalm, based on palm recognition using millimeter wave (mmWave) signals. mmWave technology has been adopted by WiGig and 5G, making mmPalm a low-cost solution that can be widely adopted in public places. In addition, the high resolution of mmWave signals allows mmPalm to extract detailed palm characteristics (e.g., palm geometry, skin thickness, and texture) that can assemble distinctive palmprints for user authentication. Our innovative virtual antennas design further increases the spatial resolution of a commercial mmWave device, enabling it to fully capture the comprehensive palmprint features. Moreover, to address the challenge of small-scale environmental changes (e.g., variations in palm-device distances and palm orientations), we design a novel palm profile augmentation method, utilizing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic palm profiles for mitigating palm instability. Furthermore, we design a cross-environment adaptation framework based on transfer learning to address the challenge of large-scale environmental changes, including multipath variations introduced by human bodies and nearby furniture. Extensive experiments with 30 participants through 6 months demonstrate that mmPalm achieves 99% authentication accuracy with resilience against different types of attacks, including random, impersonation, and counterfeit.",

Extensive experiments with 30 participants through 6 months demonstrate that mmPalm achieves 99% authentication accuracy with resilience against different types of attacks, including random, impersonation, and counterfeit.",

However, since CD labels are difficult to obtain, how to utilize semantic information in RS images to improve the change prediction performance is a problem worth exploring. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based CD method that utilizes a diffusion generation model to translate high-level semantic information into low-level change information. First, we propose a pseudo-change image pair generation method that utilizes semantic labels to guide the diffusion model to generate change images. Then, the refined loss (RL) is designed to improve the model's ability to recognize change features based on the difference between pseudo-change image pairs and unlabeled image pairs. Experimental results on WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and GoogleGZ-CD datasets show that the proposed method effectively transfers the semantic information into change information and finally improves the model's feature recognition ability for change objects.

Therefore, in this paper, we deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide stable aerial wireless communication channels for Internet-of-autonomous vehicles (IoA Vs), assisted by ground reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Nevertheless, the path planning for the UAV is challenging as the UAV should maneuver among the skyscrapers. This requires energy-efficient obstacle-free path planning while considering UAV kinematics, i.e., speed, nonholonomic constraints, etc. Besides, the UAV should fly through the paths that provide maximum line-of-sight (LoS) channels for IoA Vs, which increases the time complexity of the path planner.

However, hyperspectral imaging usually suffers from low spatial resolution and high cost, which limits the wide application of hyperspectral data. Spectral super-resolution provides a promising solution to acquire hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution and low cost, taking RGB images as input. Existing spectral super-resolution methods utilize neural networks following a single-shot framework, i.e., final results are obtained by one-stage spectral super-resolution, which struggles to capture and model the complex relationships between spectral bands.

This study identifies and quantifies these biases by comparing conventional SVI with views from the road shoulder\/sidewalk. To mitigate such perspective biases, we introduce a novel framework with generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image generation models (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN), an image regression model (ResNet-50), and a tabular model (LightGBM). Experiments assessed model effectiveness in translating car-centric views to those from pedestrian and cyclist perspectives. Results show significant differences in semantic indicators (e.g. green view index) between road center and road shoulder\/sidewalk SVI, with low Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients r (0.35\u20130.55 for road shoulders and 0.45\u20130.47 for sidewalks) indicating bias. The framework succeeded in creating realistic images and aligning pixel ratios between perspectives, achieving strong correlation coefficients (0.81 for road shoulders and 0.83 for sidewalks), thus reducing bias.

To address this issue, this paper presents a novel data augmentation solution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By collecting sensor-based traffic speed data with contextual labels and training a GAN-based model to generate realistic traffic data for specific days and times, this research successfully proposes a solution to the problem of data scarcity. The generated data undergoes comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its potential to enhance ITS applications. Furthermore, the generated data is utilized to augment the training data for multiple traffic prediction models, effectively enhancing their performance.

However, these applications often face a significant challenge - data scarcity. Insufficient data limits the effectiveness of machine learning models in the context of ITS.",
        "contribution":"To address this issue, this paper presents a novel data augmentation solution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By collecting sensor-based traffic speed data with contextual labels and training a GAN-based model to generate realistic traffic data for specific days and times, this research successfully proposes a solution to the problem of data scarcity. The generated data undergoes comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its potential to enhance ITS applications. Furthermore, the generated data is utilized to augment the training data for multiple traffic prediction models, effectively enhancing their performance. This approach opens new avenues for the development of intelligent and sustainable transportation systems, ultimately contributing to the advancement of smarter and more resilient cities.",

This knowledge is crucial for a variety of fields, such as meteorology and agriculture, environmental science, urban planning and construction, tourism, and cultural preservation. Currently available datasets in the field of scene change understanding primarily concentrate on two main tasks: the detection of changed regions within a scene and the linguistic description of the change content. Existing datasets focus on recognizing discrete changes, such as adding or deleting an object from two images, and largely rely on artificially generated images. Consequently, the existing change understanding methods primarily focus on identifying distinct object differences, overlooking the importance of continuous, gradual changes occurring over extended time intervals. To address the above issues, we propose a novel benchmark dataset, STVchrono, targeting the localization and description of long-term continuous changes in real-world scenes. The dataset consists of 71,900 photographs from Google Street View API taken over an 18-year span across 50 cities all over the world. Our STVchrono dataset is designed to support real-world continuous change recognition and description in both image pairs and extended image sequences, while also enabling the segmentation of changed regions. We conduct experiments to evaluate state-of-the- art methods on continuous change description and segmentation, as well as multimodal Large Language Models for describing changes. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced methods lag human performance, emphasizing the need to adapt them to continuously changing real-world scenarios.

The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns.

        "abstract":"The 3D virtual terrain generation is currently used in geography teaching and setting up relevant virtual scenes according to the teaching content, which can visually display the verification experimental conditions and results and enhance the universality of virtual geography experiments. In the field of digital twin smart city, traffic, and water simulation, constructing virtual terrain according to the real terrain can provide the basic environment for subsequent development and experiments. In military simulation, it can quickly build beyond the real scenes of extreme training environment, which has a key role in improving military training and enhancing combat capabilities. Hand-drawn feature sketches can express 3D virtual terrain under human subjective perception. Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details.

        "introduction":"The 3D virtual terrain generation is currently used in geography teaching and setting up relevant virtual scenes according to the teaching content, which can visually display the verification experimental conditions and results and enhance the universality of virtual geography experiments. In the field of digital twin smart city, traffic, and water simulation, constructing virtual terrain according to the real terrain can provide the basic environment for subsequent development and experiments. In military simulation, it can quickly build beyond the real scenes of extreme training environment, which has a key role in improving military training and enhancing combat capabilities. Hand-drawn feature sketches can express 3D virtual terrain under human subjective perception. Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details. This model is applied to the real natural landscape display and terrain evolution, and it can meet the user\u2019s needs to obtain the virtual terrain with high realistic feeling after inputting the hand-drawn terrain feature sketch.",

Leveraging IoT, AI, and analytics enables smart charging that aligns with renewable energy goals, addresses infrastructure limitations, and promotes sustainable transportation by improving user experience, cutting costs, and boosting trust in electric vehicles. This research aims to create a synthetic data set for electric vehicles using an enhanced Generative adversarial network model and, from that, predict the energy for charging electric vehicles using ensemble Machine Learning algorithms. The importance of more detailed features for the best-performing machine learning model has been done utilizing Explainable Artificial Intelligence, specifically, the Shapley Additive Explanations approach, to provide more understanding and derive the inter-dependency among features. The enhanced TemporalCharge Generative adversarial network model provides Skewness and Kurtosis values as -0.51 and -0.182, respectively, for synthetically generated data for the city of Berhampur, Odisha, India, which is very close to four-wheeler electric vehicle charging data of the city.

Leveraging IoT, AI, and analytics enables smart charging that aligns with renewable energy goals, addresses infrastructure limitations, and promotes sustainable transportation by improving user experience, cutting costs, and boosting trust in electric vehicles.",
        "contribution":"This research aims to create a synthetic data set for electric vehicles using an enhanced Generative adversarial network model and, from that, predict the energy for charging electric vehicles using ensemble Machine Learning algorithms. The importance of more detailed features for the best-performing machine learning model has been done utilizing Explainable Artificial Intelligence, specifically, the Shapley Additive Explanations approach, to provide more understanding and derive the inter-dependency among features. The enhanced TemporalCharge Generative adversarial network model provides Skewness and Kurtosis values as -0.51 and -0.182, respectively, for synthetically generated data for the city of Berhampur, Odisha, India, which is very close to four-wheeler electric vehicle charging data of the city. Several plots illustrate the influence of key features on electric vehicle energy consumption during charging, which enhances user optimization, owner empowerment, and ecosystem sustainability.",

Our paper introduces a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic traffic data that closely mimics real-world statistics. This artificial dataset enhances our new 5GT-GAN-NET-based prediction model. The result is a significant boost in prediction accuracy, with Mean Square Error (MSE) reduced to 0.000346 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to 0.00685. Compared to benchmarks, our model improves MSE and MAE by up to 95.45% with respect to the ARIMA model and 87.31% with respect to the NARNN model respectively. User privacy remains a cornerstone of our approach, crucial for smart city applications. Our predictive capabilities enable more efficient resource allocation by service providers, increasing communication infrastructure reliability. Although tailored for smart cities, the approach is adaptable to other fields facing data scarcity and privacy concerns. Our research highlights the potential of GANs in generating large, accurate datasets for traffic prediction in 5G environments while prioritizing user privacy.",

        "contribution":"Our paper introduces a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic traffic data that closely mimics real-world statistics. This artificial dataset enhances our new 5GT-GAN-NET-based prediction model. The result is a significant boost in prediction accuracy, with Mean Square Error (MSE) reduced to 0.000346 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to 0.00685. Compared to benchmarks, our model improves MSE and MAE by up to 95.45% with respect to the ARIMA model and 87.31% with respect to the NARNN model respectively. User privacy remains a cornerstone of our approach, crucial for smart city applications. Our predictive capabilities enable more efficient resource allocation by service providers, increasing communication infrastructure reliability. Although tailored for smart cities, the approach is adaptable to other fields facing data scarcity and privacy concerns. Our research highlights the potential of GANs in generating large, accurate datasets for traffic prediction in 5G environments while prioritizing user privacy.",

It is crucial for various applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and urban planning, as it enables comprehensive and accurate analysis by combining the visual information of optical images with the penetrating capability of SAR images. However, the differences in imaging mechanisms between optical and SAR images result in significant nonlinear radiation distortion. Especially for SAR images, which are affected by speckle noises, resulting in low resolution and blurry edge structures, making optical and SAR image matching difficult and challenging. The key to successful matching lies in reducing modal differences and extracting similarity information from the images.

The core innovation of this paper is that we take inspiration from the concept of image generation, to handle the predicament of image matching between different modalities. Firstly, we introduce the Attention U-Net as a generator to decouple and characterize optical images.

At the same time, using the structural similarity (SSIM) to constrain structural spatial information to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, a conditional generative adversarial network is employed to further guide the image generation process. By combining synthesized SAR images and their corresponding optical images in a dual channel, we can enhance prior information.

        "introduction":"Fast and reliable identification of cyber attacks in network systems of smart cities is currently a critical and demanding task. Machine learning algorithms have been used for intrusion detection, but the existing data sets intended for their training are often imbalanced, which can reduce the effectiveness of the proposed model. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can solve the problem but have limitations, such as the risk of overfitting and information loss. Furthermore, network data logs are noisy and inconsistent, making it challenging to capture essential patterns in the data accurately.",
        "contribution":"To address these issues, this study proposes using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic network traffic data. The results offer new insight into developing more effective intrusion detection systems, especially in the context of smart cities\u2019 network infrastructure.",

To address the intricate nature of transportation issues, many researchers and planners have analyzed the complexities of urban and regional road systems using transportation models by employing transportation indices such as road length, network density, accessibility, and connectivity metrics. This study addresses the complexities of predicting road network density for small and medium-sized Indian cities that come under the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) project at a national level. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and the CityGAN model is introduced to predict network density using spatial indicators of human settlements. The major goal of this study is to generate hyper-realistic urban patterns of small and medium-sized Indian cities using an unsupervised CityGAN model and to study the causal relationship between human settlement indices (HSIs) and transportation index (network density) using supervised KRR for the real cities. The synthetic urban universes mimic Indian urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through the settlement indices can aid in comprehending urban landscape, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. We analyzed 503 real cities to find the actual relationship between the urban settlements and their road density. The nonlinear KRR model may help urban planners in deriving the network density for GAN-generated futuristic urban patterns through the settlement indicators. The proposed hybrid process, termed as RidgeGAN model, can gauge the sustainability of urban sprawl tied to infrastructure and transportation systems in sprawling cities. Analysis results clearly demonstrate the utility of RidgeGAN in predicting network density for different kinds of human settlements, particularly for small and medium Indian cities.

The research question of this paper is: How can we make agents behave more realistically to analyze citizens' mobility behavior? To solve this problem, we first created a simulated virtual environment, where agents can move freely in a small part of a city, the harbor area in Hamburg, Germany. We assumed that happiness is a crucial motivating factor for the movement of citizens. A survey of 130 citizens provided the weights that govern the simulated environment and the happiness score assignation of places.

Through randomly traversing the model environment a baseline was created. We are in the process of enhancing Reinforcement Learning with a Deep Q-Network to make the actors learn. Early experiments show a significant improvement over a tabular Q-learning approach. This paper contributes to the literature of urban planning, and data-driven architectural design.

Urban flow, a typical kind of geospatial data, is critical for a wide range of applications from public safety and traffic management to urban planning.

Some other studies aim to predict OD flow among regions but they fail to model dynamic changes of urban flow over time. In this work, we study a new problem of urban flow generation that generates dynamic urban flow for regions without historical flow data. To capture the effect of multiple factors on urban flow, such as region features and urban environment, we employ diffusion model to generate urban flow for regions under different conditions. We first construct an urban knowledge graph (UKG) to model the urban environment and relationships between regions, based on which we design a knowledge-enhanced spatio-temporal diffusion model (KSTDiff) to generate urban flow for each region. Specifically, to accurately generate urban flow for regions with different flow volumes, we design a novel diffusion process guided by a volume estimator, which is learnable and customized for each region. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-enhanced denoising network to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of urban flow as well as the impact of urban environment in the denoising process.

For example, pedestrians are out of the camera field of view, or data from the camera modality is missing. To address this challenge and produce more accurate location estimations for pedestrians, we propose a localization solution based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. During training, it learns the underlying linkage between pedestrians' camera-phone data correspondences. During inference, it generates refined position estimations based only on pedestrians' phone data that consists of GPS, IMU, and FTM. Results show that our GAN produces 3D coordinates at 1 to 2 meters localization error across 5 different outdoor scenes. We further show that the proposed model supports self-learning.

Hence, generating human trajectory data is a crucial but challenging task, which suffers from the following two critical challenges: 1) how to capture the user distribution in human trajectories (group view), and 2) how to model the complex mobility patterns of each user trajectory (individual view). In this paper, we propose a novel human trajectories generator (named VOLUNTEER), consisting of a user VAE and a trajectory VAE, to address the above challenges. Specifically, in the user VAE, we propose to learn the user distribution with all human trajectories from a group view. In the trajectory VAE, from the individual view, we model the complex mobility patterns by decoupling travel time and dwell time to accurately simulate individual trajectories.

However, various factors in complex scenes (e.g., high vegetation coverage occlusions) may lead to fragmentation in the extracted road networks and also affect the robustness of road extraction methods. This study proposes a multi-scale road extraction method with asymmetric generative adversarial learning (MS-AGAN). First, we design an asymmetric GAN with a multi-scale feature encoder to better utilize the context information in high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and feature fusion are integrated into the asymmetric encoder\u2013decoder structure to avoid feature redundancy caused by multi-level cascading operations and enhance the generator network\u2019s ability to extract fine-grained road information at the pixel level. Second, to maintain road connectivity, topologic features are considered in the pixel segmentation process. A linear structural similarity loss ((Formula presented.)) is introduced into the loss function of MS-AGAN, which guides MS-AGAN to generate more accurate segmentation results. Finally, to fairly evaluate the performance of deep models under complex backgrounds, the Bayesian error rate (BER) is introduced into the field of road extraction for the first time. Experiments are conducted via Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images with high vegetation coverage in the Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the public DeepGlobe dataset. The performance of MS-AGAN is compared with a list of advanced models, including RCFSNet, CoANet, UNet, DeepLabV3+, and DiResNet. The final results show that (1) with respect to road extraction performance, the Recall, F1, and IoU values of MS-AGAN on the Daxing dataset are 2.17%, 0.04%, and 2.63% higher than the baselines. On DeepGlobe, the Recall, F1, and IoU of MS-AGAN improve by 1.12%, 0.42%, and 0.25%, respectively.

The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function.

These images are typically generated based on parameters such as depth information and atmospheric scattering coefficient. However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images.

        "abstract":"Healthy and sustainable urban agglomerations development relies heavily on land use optimization. However, there is insufficient scientific basis and reliable quantitative analysis for land use pattern identification and optimal prediction in embryonic urban agglomeration. Therefore, taking the Lanzhou\u2013Xining (LX) region, a typical primary developing urban agglomeration, as the study area, we first assessed the land ecological suitability (LES). Then, we embedded the LES evaluation results in the land optimization process and constructed the MCR-MOP- Dyna-CLUE model framework, simulating and optimizing land use patterns for the year 2035 under ecological optimization and business as usual scenarios, which aimed to explore a sustainable land use pattern for embryonic urban agglomerations. The results indicated that the ecological optimization scenario based on LES had a more rational land use pattern. It appropriately controlled the expansion rate of construction land and effectively alleviated the problems of construction land encroaching on farming land and ecological land. Meanwhile, the ecosystem services increased in value based on adequately addressing the need for food security and economic development.

        "contribution":"Therefore, taking the Lanzhou\u2013Xining (LX) region, a typical primary developing urban agglomeration, as the study area, we first assessed the land ecological suitability (LES). Then, we embedded the LES evaluation results in the land optimization process and constructed the MCR-MOP- Dyna-CLUE model framework, simulating and optimizing land use patterns for the year 2035 under ecological optimization and business as usual scenarios, which aimed to explore a sustainable land use pattern for embryonic urban agglomerations. The results indicated that the ecological optimization scenario based on LES had a more rational land use pattern. It appropriately controlled the expansion rate of construction land and effectively alleviated the problems of construction land encroaching on farming land and ecological land. Meanwhile, the ecosystem services increased in value based on adequately addressing the need for food security and economic development. Compared to the business as usual scenario, the construction land under the ecological optimization scenario was 19,622.69 ha less, and the cultivated land was 32,103.29 ha more.

        "abstract":"Smart city enters the new 3.0 era, and Internet of Things (IoT) perform as the urban neural network in smart city. In the industrial areas of smart city, the IoT focuses on industrial applications, such as logistics and environmental monitoring. In this work, an auxiliary position analysis framework composed of IoT and distributed mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed to analyze the position of vehicles in the industrial areas of smart city. In the proposed framework, IoT are deployed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with uniform linear array (ULA), which receives the signal emitted by vehicles for obtaining the direction of arrival (DOA), and the distributed MEC provides computing and synchronization services to auxiliary positioning. The DOA estimation is a key issue for auxiliary positioning in the proposed framework. To realize DOA estimation with unknown mutual coupling (MC) existing in IoT nodes, a novel block sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is developed. In the developed algorithm, the unknown MC existing between sensors in each IoT nodes is first fused with the signal by parameterizing steering vector. Then, a block SBL (BSBL) procedure is presented to perform DOA estimation by using the inherent block sparse structure in the equivalent signal obtained after fusion. Benefiting from the fusion of MC and signal, the developed DOA estimation algorithm does not require a separate estimation of the unknown MC and also does not cause the loss of the array aperture. Based on the DOA estimation information, the position of vehicles in the industrial environment is effectively analyzed through weighted multiple cross-locations. Synthetic data set simulation is carried out to verify that the vehicle positions in smart city can be efficiently analyzed and estimated based on the presented framework and algorithm.",

        "contribution":"In this work, an auxiliary position analysis framework composed of IoT and distributed mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed to analyze the position of vehicles in the industrial areas of smart city. In the proposed framework, IoT are deployed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with uniform linear array (ULA), which receives the signal emitted by vehicles for obtaining the direction of arrival (DOA), and the distributed MEC provides computing and synchronization services to auxiliary positioning. The DOA estimation is a key issue for auxiliary positioning in the proposed framework. To realize DOA estimation with unknown mutual coupling (MC) existing in IoT nodes, a novel block sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is developed. In the developed algorithm, the unknown MC existing between sensors in each IoT nodes is first fused with the signal by parameterizing steering vector. Then, a block SBL (BSBL) procedure is presented to perform DOA estimation by using the inherent block sparse structure in the equivalent signal obtained after fusion. Benefiting from the fusion of MC and signal, the developed DOA estimation algorithm does not require a separate estimation of the unknown MC and also does not cause the loss of the array aperture.

        "abstract":"Image fusion is required to maximise the utilisation of the different satellite sensors and enhance the usage and quality of the images obtained from them. One can get over obstacles like varied geographical resolutions, spectral bands, and temporal coverage by fusing images from multiple satellites, such as Landsat8 and Sentinel 2. For various applications that involve observationof the Earth like land cover classification, monitoring of vegetation,disaster monitoring, and urban planning, the fusion process aims to produce composite images that integrate the spectral richness, spatial detail, and temporal frequency of the input images. The creation of Sentinel-like imagery from Landsat8 data enhances its potential for Earth observation applications, making the problem of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 imagery fusion very important to solve. A deep learning methodology is required to solve this problem because of its capacity to discover complex correlations and patterns within the data.

        "introduction":"Image fusion is required to maximise the utilisation of the different satellite sensors and enhance the usage and quality of the images obtained from them. One can get over obstacles like varied geographical resolutions, spectral bands, and temporal coverage by fusing images from multiple satellites, such as Landsat8 and Sentinel 2. For various applications that involve observationof the Earth like land cover classification, monitoring of vegetation,disaster monitoring, and urban planning, the fusion process aims to produce composite images that integrate the spectral richness, spatial detail, and temporal frequency of the input images. The creation of Sentinel-like imagery from Landsat8 data enhances its potential for Earth observation applications, making the problem of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 imagery fusion very important to solve. A deep learning methodology is required to solve this problem because of its capacity to discover complex correlations and patterns within the data.",

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) style transfer can help with modelling how the city would look if restored using techniques from selected European cities.

This paper presents a novel approach to urban restoration planning using GANs to capture and translate architectural and urban planning styles from European cities into the reconstruction of a Ukrainian city. The study focuses on the destroyed city of Mariupol and evaluates the impact of these stylistic influences on greenspace distribution in the restored urban environment. In our case study, we transferred architectural features of Polish and Italian urban project and determined that for this specific city, the Polish urban planning model would be more beneficiary.

        "abstract":"This paper introduces 5GT-GAN, a novel approach leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic mobile Internet traffic data, particularly tailored to smart city applications. Given the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns in the context of 5G, generating synthetic data becomes a crucial aspect for effectively deploying AI-driven systems in real-world scenarios. 5GT-GAN integrates unsupervised GAN schemes with the ability to manage temporal dynamics through supervised autoregressive models, successfully generating large-scale synthetic mobile Internet traffic data. Our experimental results illustrate the superior performance of 5GT-GAN in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) compared to traditional models.

Given the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns in the context of 5G, generating synthetic data becomes a crucial aspect for effectively deploying AI-driven systems in real-world scenarios. 5GT-GAN integrates unsupervised GAN schemes with the ability to manage temporal dynamics through supervised autoregressive models, successfully generating large-scale synthetic mobile Internet traffic data. Our experimental results illustrate the superior performance of 5GT-GAN in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) compared to traditional models.

However, there are two problems: the inability to remove arbitrary buildings and the inability to generate a landscape after reconstruction. Therefore, this study proposes a future landscape visualization method that integrates instance segmentation and a diffusion model. The proposed method can generate both post-removal images of existing buildings and post-reconstruction images based on text input, without the need for specialized technology or labor.

To address these problems, recent research focuses on generating synthetic trajectories, mainly using generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained by real-world trajectories. In this paper, we hypothesize that by explicitly capturing the modality of transportation (e.g., walking, biking, driving), we can generate not only more diverse and representative trajectories for different modalities but also more realistic trajectories that preserve the geographical density, trajectory, and transition level properties by capturing both cross-modality and modality-specific patterns. Towards this end, we propose a Clustering-based Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (CSGAN)1 that simultaneously clusters the trajectories based on their modalities and learns the essential properties of real-world trajectories to generate realistic and representative synthetic trajectories. To measure the effectiveness of generated trajectories, in addition to typical density and trajectory level statistics, we define several new metrics for a comprehensive evaluation, including modality distribution and transition probabilities both globally and within each modality.

We assess the quality of the generated data by constructing several taxi-demand prediction models. Moreover, we evaluate the privacy risk by implementing trajectory user linking attacks against the generated data and membership inference attacks against the prediction model. Our system is designed with rich interactivity and visualization, enabling the audience to use these modules. Overall, our approach demonstrates the potential of generative models in preserving privacy while maintaining data utility in the context of taxi-demand prediction.",

Distributed generation (DG) and electric vehicle charging infrastructure play a vital role in the planning and construction of smart cities. However, the uncertainty associated with the power output of distributed generation significantly impacts the planning of distribution networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a site-selection recommendation algorithm that leverages urban multimedia data and improved generative adversarial networks. The proposed algorithm begins by modeling the uncertainty of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) generation using an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network model. To generate multimedia datasets with time-series characteristics for wind power and PV generation scenarios, monthly multimedia data labels are incorporated into the model. These multimedia datasets, representing a wide range of scenarios, are then clustered using the K-means clustering method. Furthermore, a distributed generation planning model is established, aiming to minimize the annual integrated cost. The planning problem is efficiently solved using CPLEX, a mathematical programming solver. In the simulation experiments, the proposed scheme is compared with alternative schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a significant total cost saving of 21.95% compared to the comparison scheme. Moreover, the experimental comparison reveals that the proposed scheme exhibits higher stability. Additionally, in terms of algorithm efficiency, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms tested in terms of the number of iterations and speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed planning model in improving the economy and stability of the distribution network.

It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

After testing and training the model for many times, the corresponding modeling image was acquired. After aligning this image and positioning coordinates, it was substituted in the suitable modeling scene, and finally the fast modeling of buildings was realized.

        "contribution":"This paper took deep learning as the basic premise to design the 3D visualization model based on StyleGAN2 algorithm. That is, firstly, StyleGAN2 algorithm was used to segment the image, and Three JS was selected as the Web 3D visualization framework for the model; then the 3D visualization model based on StyleGAN2 algorithm was constructed. After testing and training the model for many times, the corresponding modeling image was acquired. After aligning this image and positioning coordinates, it was substituted in the suitable modeling scene, and finally the fast modeling of buildings was realized. The results show that StyleGAN2 algorithm has superior performance and high modeling efficiency, which can lead to lower modeling cost and thus promote the improvement of 3D visualization of urban buildings.",

The data generated by GANs can achieve high quality to augment downstream training or to complete missing entries in a dataset. GANs can also be used to learn the relationship between two datasets and translate one into another, e.g. road network data into building footprint data. However, such approach has not been developed in the geospatial and urban data science context, its usability remains unknown, and the methods are not fully developed. We develop a new Geographical Data Translation algorithm based on GAN to generate high-resolution vector building data solely from street networks, which may be used to predict the urban morphology in absence of building data, also enabling studies in unmapped or undermapped urban geographies, among other advantages. Experiments on 16 cities around the world demonstrate that the generated datasets are largely successful in resembling ground truth morphologies. Thus, the approach may be used in lieu of traditional data for tasks that are often hampered by lack of data, e.g. urban form studies, simulation of urban morphologies in new contexts, and spatial data quality assessment. Our work proposes a novel rapid approach to generate building footprints in replacement of procedural methods and it introduces a new intrinsic method for large-scale spatial data quality control, which we test on OpenStreetMap by predicting missing buildings and suggesting the completeness of data without the usually required authoritative counterparts.

Experiments on 16 cities around the world demonstrate that the generated datasets are largely successful in resembling ground truth morphologies. Thus, the approach may be used in lieu of traditional data for tasks that are often hampered by lack of data, e.g. urban form studies, simulation of urban morphologies in new contexts, and spatial data quality assessment. Our work proposes a novel rapid approach to generate building footprints in replacement of procedural methods and it introduces a new intrinsic method for large-scale spatial data quality control, which we test on OpenStreetMap by predicting missing buildings and suggesting the completeness of data without the usually required authoritative counterparts. The code, sample model, and dataset are available openly.",

Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities. This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different fa\u00e7ade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments.

In this study, a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is used to construct a method for deriving the distribution of urban texture through the distribution hotspots of the COVID-19 epidemic. At the same time, the relationship between urban form and the COVID-19 epidemic is established, so that the machine can automatically deduce and calculate the appearance of urban forms that are prone to epidemics and may have high risks, which has application value and potential in the field of planning and design. In this study, taking Macau as an example, this method was used to conduct model training, image generation, and comparison of the derivation results of different assumed epidemic distribution degrees. The implications of this study for urban planning are as follows: (1) there is a correlation between different urban forms and the distribution of epidemics, and CGAN can be used to predict urban forms with high epidemic risk; (2) large-scale buildings and high-density buildings can promote the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; (3) green public open spaces and squares have an inhibitory effect on the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; and (4) reducing the volume and density of buildings and increasing the area of green public open spaces and squares can help reduce the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

        "contribution":"In this study, a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is used to construct a method for deriving the distribution of urban texture through the distribution hotspots of the COVID-19 epidemic. At the same time, the relationship between urban form and the COVID-19 epidemic is established, so that the machine can automatically deduce and calculate the appearance of urban forms that are prone to epidemics and may have high risks, which has application value and potential in the field of planning and design. In this study, taking Macau as an example, this method was used to conduct model training, image generation, and comparison of the derivation results of different assumed epidemic distribution degrees. The implications of this study for urban planning are as follows: (1) there is a correlation between different urban forms and the distribution of epidemics, and CGAN can be used to predict urban forms with high epidemic risk; (2) large-scale buildings and high-density buildings can promote the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; (3) green public open spaces and squares have an inhibitory effect on the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic; and (4) reducing the volume and density of buildings and increasing the area of green public open spaces and squares can help reduce the distribution of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

We analyzed 100 articles to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on how GANs are currently applied to solve challenging tasks in the built environment. Our results show that: (i) GANs are replacing older methods in some problems and setting state-of-the-art performances; (ii) GANs are opening new frontiers in previously overlooked problems, such as automatically generating spatially accurate floorplan layouts; (iii) GANs can be applied to different scales in the built environment, from entire cities to neighborhoods and buildings; and (iv) GANs are being used in a variety of problems and data types, from remote sensing data augmentation, vector data generation, spatio-temporal data privacy protection, to building design generation. In total, there are 26 unique application domains enabled by GANs; (v) however, one common challenge in this field currently is the lack of high-quality datasets curated specifically for problems in the built environment. With more data in the future, GANs could potentially produce even better results than today.",

However, even the most well-funded surveying agencies rely on sampling methods to estimate the nature of the true population, and the collected microdata is frequently aggregated, or limited in volume and detail to protect the privacy of respondents. Population synthesis provides a means to scale this microdata to represent larger regions for use in microsimulation. Despite their accuracy and widespread adoption, traditional synthesis algorithms for reweighting microdata samples scale poorly with the number of variables and geographic regions being modeled, and can suffer from non-convergence with smaller sample sizes. Several generative models have been proposed to address these shortcomings, but lack features such as sub-region modeling, and the ability to simultaneously generate both individuals and households. This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE\/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE\/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4\u201316 variables). The VAE\/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples.",

Here, we propose a GAN framework with geographical knowledge, namely Metropolitan GAN (MetroGAN), for urban morphology simulation. We incorporate a progressive growing structure to learn hierarchical features and design a geographical loss to impose the constraints of water areas. Besides, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for the complex structure of urban systems.

        "abstract":"Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent city construction and public crisis management. Distinct from the single trajectory prediction which rely on strong temporal correlation, in the complex scenes, the trajectory reflects not only the temporal characteristics of a single person, but the interactive features between human and other moving objects nearby. Therefore, how to deeply describe such temporality and interactivity, and then to generate accurate trajectory prediction results according to the change of the scene has become a major problem in the field of trajectory prediction today. In recent years, deep learning has attracted great attention and achieved success in the trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods capture the influence between pedestrians from a single view, and they fail to consider the multiple factors which have an effect on the decision of pedestrians, such as going straight or turning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time.",

For these tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the dominant solution for the past decade, for their remarkable ability in learning discriminative features from images to boost retrieval performance. However, it is been discovered that DNNs are broadly vulnerable to maliciously constructed adversarial examples. By adding small perturbations to a query image, the returned retrieval results will be completely dissimilar from the query image. This poses serious challenges to vital systems in Smart City applications that depend on the DNN-based visual retrieval technology, as in the physical world, simple camouflage can be added on the subject (a few patches on the body or car), and turn the subject completely untrackable by person or vehicle Re-ID systems. To demonstrate the potential of such threats, this paper proposes a novel adversarial patch generative adversarial network (AP-GAN) to generate adversarial patches instead of modifying the entire image, which also causes the DNNs-based image retrieval models to return incorrect results. AP-GAN is trained in an unsupervised way that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once trained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries. Extensive experiments show that the AP-GAN achieves excellent attacking performance with various application scenarios that are based on deep features, including image retrieval, person ReID and vehicle ReID. The results of this study provide a warning that when deploying a DNNs-based image retrieval system, its security and robustness needs to be thoroughly considered.",

These extend to various areas in sustainability, including for satellite image analysis to obtain information such as land usage and extent of development. An interesting direction for which data-driven methods have not been applied much yet is in the quick quantitative evaluation of urban layouts for planning and design. In particular, urban designs typically involve complex trade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up and\/or consideration of urban heat island effect. Hence, it can be beneficial to urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban characteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity, without having to run compu-tationally expensive and time-consuming high-fidelity numerical simulations each time. This fast surrogate can then be potentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including generative models or other gradient-based methods. Here we present an investigation into the use of convolutional neural networks as a surrogate for urban layout characterization that is typically done via high-fidelity numerical simulation. We then further apply this model towards a first demonstration of its utility for data-driven pedestrian-level wind velocity prediction. The data set in this work comprises results from high-fidelity numerical simulations of wind velocities for a diverse set of realistic urban layouts, based on randomized samples from a real-world, highly built-up urban city. We then provide prediction results obtained from the neural network trained on this data-set, demonstrating test errors of under 0.1 m\/s for previously unseen novel urban layouts. We further illustrate how this can be useful for purposes such as rapid evaluation of pedestrian wind velocity for a potential new layout. In addition, it is hoped that this data set will further inspire, facilitate and accelerate research in data-driven urban AI, even as our baseline model facilitates quantitative comparison to future, more innovative methods.",

In this paper, we aim to solve the conditional urban traffic estimation problem in case of data scarcity (i.e., the target city cannot provide any prior data) and tackle the main challenges including (1) knowledge learning from the source and (2) knowledge adaptation without prior traffic data. We propose a novel generative adversarial network - Meta Spatial-Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (Mest-GAN), which can successfully estimate traffic in the target city based on local travel demands without the access to any prior traffic data. To address the first challenge, we learn the latent distribution of travel demands with the inference network, the latent distribution also indicates the diverse spatial-temporal traffic patterns. To solve the second challenge, we use the travel demand data in the target city for adaptation, where the inference network infers a latent code guiding the generator to produce accurate traffic estimations. Extensive experiments on real-world multiple-city datasets demonstrate that our Mest-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

This paper presents a new visualization tool for WDN that overcomes current challenges and provides water companies with useful managing information. Existing visualization tools are self-contained systems that work independently from other visualization software and do not provide real-time analysis of the pipes and water flow status in the WDN. Using digital maps such as Google Maps it is possible to extend the traditional digital representation of the WDN based on EPANET software. Moreover, the WDN representation can be enriched with localized information (e.g. roads or buildings superimposed on the WDN), that is useful for planning maintenance and structural services. In presence of a WDN equipped with sensors and flowmeters, the proposed tool can be used for optimized visualization of the flow rate and the condition of the pipes in real-time. For these reasons, this tool can be a powerful instrument to help technicians quickly identify problems in the WDN. In this work, we used synthetic data generation techniques to obtain a data-set of values that updated over time. Finally, to evaluate the designed solution, we implemented the proposed visualization tool and performed some experiments to test its effectiveness.",

Moreover, the WDN representation can be enriched with localized information (e.g. roads or buildings superimposed on the WDN), that is useful for planning maintenance and structural services. In presence of a WDN equipped with sensors and flowmeters, the proposed tool can be used for optimized visualization of the flow rate and the condition of the pipes in real-time. For these reasons, this tool can be a powerful instrument to help technicians quickly identify problems in the WDN. In this work, we used synthetic data generation techniques to obtain a data-set of values that updated over time. Finally, to evaluate the designed solution, we implemented the proposed visualization tool and performed some experiments to test its effectiveness.",

Due to larger data scale and more complex data structure, queries over such data are more complicated and expensive than those on traditional spatial data, which poses challenges to the system efficiency and deployment costs. The existing spatial databases have limited support in both data types and operations. Therefore, a new-generation spatial database with excellent performance and effective deployment costs is needed. This paper presents Ganos, a cloud-native spatial database engine of PolarDB for PostgreSQL that is developed by Alibaba Cloud, to efficiently manage multidimensional, dynamic, and scene-oriented spatial data. Ganos models 3D space and spatio-temporal dynamics as first-class citizens. Also, it natively supports spatial\/spatio-temporal data types such as 3DMesh, Trajectory, Raster, PointCloud, etc. Besides, it implements a novel extended-storage mechanism that utilizes cloud-native object storage to reduce storage costs and enable uniform operations on the data in different storages. To facilitate processing \u201cbig\u201d queries, Ganos extends PolarDB and provides spatial-oriented multi-level parallelism under the architecture of decoupling compute from storage in cloud-native databases, which achieves elasticity and excellent query performance. We demonstrate Ganos in real-life case studies. The performance of Ganos is evaluated using real datasets, and promising results are obtained.

The total recognition time is reduced by more than 49.4%, and the performance is improved significantly. (2) Compared with other popular algorithms, the constructed GAN-based automatic artistic typeface generation model has the best quality of the generation of huaniao on both the pencil sketch and the calligraphy character image dataset. Models have broad application prospects in contemporary advertising text art design. This study aims to provide important technical support for the automation of contemporary advertising text art design and the improvement of overall efficiency.",

We show how to speed up the discovery of unoccluded objects and relate the confidence in this discovery to the rate and accuracy of training occluded objects.

This study presents a rotational sNMR measurement scheme to accurately image a frozen urban lake. Through synthetic data experiments, we first demonstrate that sNMR data measured with six rotations can accurately invert underground water-bearing structures. Even when the environmental noise is high, this scheme can reflect the distribution of the water content in a frozen lake. Moreover, due to the small coil size, the inversion result is less affected by the underground resistivity. In field experiments, a large amount of high-quality sNMR data with average SNRs up to 12.8 dB were obtained from a high-noise environment using three reference coils. The 2-D distributions of the water content in the ice, water, and mud layers of the frozen lake were determined using the data measured from six rotations. The water content in the lake was found to be approximately equal to 1 m3\/m3. Although there are still some problems with the measurements, such as inaccurate relaxation times and low resolutions in deep areas, further improvements in sNMR and the rotational detection scheme can facilitate the application of this approach to urban groundwater detection.",

Re-ID has gained significantly increased advancement in recent years. However, real data annotation is costly and model generalization ability is hindered by the lack of large-scale and diverse data. To address this problem, we propose a Weather Person pipeline that can generate a synthesized Re-ID dataset with different weather, scenes, and natural lighting conditions automatically. The pipeline is built on the top of a game engine which contains a digital city, weather and lighting simulation system, and various character models with manifold dressing. To train a generalizable Re-ID model from the large-scale virtual WePerson dataset, we design an adaptive sample selection strategy to close the domain gap and avoid redundancy.

        "introduction":"The aim of person re-identification (Re-ID) is retrieving a person of interest across multiple non-overlapping cameras. Re-ID has gained significantly increased advancement in recent years. However, real data annotation is costly and model generalization ability is hindered by the lack of large-scale and diverse data.",
        "contribution":"To address this problem, we propose a Weather Person pipeline that can generate a synthesized Re-ID dataset with different weather, scenes, and natural lighting conditions automatically. The pipeline is built on the top of a game engine which contains a digital city, weather and lighting simulation system, and various character models with manifold dressing. To train a generalizable Re-ID model from the large-scale virtual WePerson dataset, we design an adaptive sample selection strategy to close the domain gap and avoid redundancy. We also design an informative sampling method for a mini-batch sampler to accelerate the learning process.

For the PA attributes, the MUG showed stronger effects than the surrounding environment. The key environmental features included the slope and type of MUG, of which the former was negatively associated with distance and speed. The T-MUG ratio was positively related to duration and speed, while the R-MUG ratio was positively related to duration and distance. No association was found between livelihood (L-MUG) and PA.

To alleviate this problem, time series augmentation aims to generate synthetic time series by learning useful features from collected time series. As the popular generative model, generative adversarial networks (GAN) is regarded as a promising model for time series augmentation. However, applying GAN to the time series data suffers from a challenge in which the generated instances hold low quality but the model has gotten saturation. In this paper, for time series augmentation, we proposed TSA-GAN which is a robust GAN model with a self-adaptive recovering strategy to solve this problem. On 85 datasets of the UCR 2015 archive, our proposed TSA-GAN helps time series classifiers achieve performance improvements ranging from 8.3% to 12.5%, which is far better than the baseline.",

        "introduction":"Time series classification (TSC) is widely used in various real-world applications such as human activity recognition, smart city governance, etc. Unfortunately, due to different reasons, only part of time series could be collected which may obviously degrade the performance of time series classifiers. To alleviate this problem, time series augmentation aims to generate synthetic time series by learning useful features from collected time series. As the popular generative model, generative adversarial networks (GAN) is regarded as a promising model for time series augmentation. However, applying GAN to the time series data suffers from a challenge in which the generated instances hold low quality but the model has gotten saturation.",
        "contribution":"In this paper, for time series augmentation, we proposed TSA-GAN which is a robust GAN model with a self-adaptive recovering strategy to solve this problem. On 85 datasets of the UCR 2015 archive, our proposed TSA-GAN helps time series classifiers achieve performance improvements ranging from 8.3% to 12.5%, which is far better than the baseline.",

Synthetic generation also inherently carries anonymity. In particular, our work focuses on modeling both spatial and temporal distributions jointly for ride-hailing services. A Ride-Request Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (RR-WGAN) is proposed to generate plausible pick-up and drop-off geolocations. The generated ride-requests are extensively evaluated under a wide range of criteria we design, giving a comprehensive understanding of how the model performs.

Synthetic generation also inherently carries anonymity. In particular, our work focuses on modeling both spatial and temporal distributions jointly for ride-hailing services. A Ride-Request Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (RR-WGAN) is proposed to generate plausible pick-up and drop-off geolocations. The generated ride-requests are extensively evaluated under a wide range of criteria we design, giving a comprehensive understanding of how the model performs. The proposed approach has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art methods in most scenarios. We believe this approach could provide value for ride-hailing service providers, research communities, and policy-makers.",

        "abstract":"Texture is one of the important information in the three-Dimensional (3D) city photorealistic mapping, which usually occupies large computer memory for storage. As a result, the effective modeling and organization of texture data become an important issue in geographic information science community. Hence, this paper proposes the Fractal Viewing Distance (FVD) multi-resolution texture data generation and organization method for 3D city building photorealistic mapping. First, a fractal compression method based on the self-similarity and self-affine properties of texture is developed, which compresses and stores texture and 3D building model data in the database. Second, the corresponding texture is created and organized according to the visual distance and the visibility of the target facade. When the visual distance meets the texture calling condition and the target facade is visible, the texture data is iteratively decompressed, and the number of texture resampling is determined to create multi-resolution texture data. A texture index is established and stored in a database according to the relationship between various types of 3D building model data. When the visual distance does not meet the texture calling condition, but the target facade is visible, the building facade texture is represented using a colored texture tree created in this paper. The method smooths the texture and divides it into different rectangles as nodes based on the color difference, and then a colored texture tree is built to store these nodes. In the process of model visualization, the nodes are merged to represent the texture. Finally, the corresponding texture is selected according to the angle of view and distance, representing the dynamic and smooth visualization of the 3D model. The experimental field consisting of a total of 5290 texture data, located in Lixia District, Jinan City, Shandong Province is selected to validate the method we proposed, which occupies a total size of 6.1G. The results demonstrate that when the number of decompressing iterations reaches around 8 or 10, the peak ratio of signal to noise of each texture tends to be stable. The average memory consumption is approximately 54.7%, and the frame rate for building fa\u00e7ade mapping is at about 42 frames per second. Compared with 3ds Max and SketchUp Pro, the proposed method reduces the memory occupation by about 36.5 % and 49.1%, respectively, and increase the frame rate approximately by 7 % and 10.9 %, respectively. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a good balance between rendering efficiency and visual quality of 3D building model.

To build a virtual city that are close to a real city, a large number of various types of human models need to be created. To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape\u2013pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.",

        "contribution":"To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape\u2013pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.",

        "abstract":"Objective: Computer vision makes the camera and computer the \"eyes\" of the computer, which can have the abilities of segmentation, classification, recognition, tracking and decision-making. In recent years, computer vision technology has been widely used in intelligent transportation, unmanned driving, robot navigation, intelligent video monitoring, and many other fields. At present, the camera has become the most commonly used sensing equipment in automatic driving and smart cities, generating massive image and video data. We can realize real-time analysis and processing of these data only by relying on computer vision technology. We can detect all kinds of objects in real time and obtain their position and motion states accurately from the image video. However, the actual scene has a very high complexity. Many complex factors interweave together, which poses a great challenge to the visual computing system. At present, computer vision technology is mainly based on the deep learning method through large-scale data-driven mechanisms. Sufficient data are needed due to the heavy dependence of its training algorithm mechanism on datasets. However, collecting and labeling large-scale image data from actual scenes are time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks, and usually, only small-scale and limited diversity of image data can be obtained. For example, Microsoft common objects in context(MS COCO), a popular dataset used for instance segmentation tasks, has a size of about 300 000 and mainly 91 categories. Expressing the complexity of reality and simulate the real situation is difficult. The model trained on the limited dataset will lack practical significance, because the dataset is not large enough to represent the real data distribution and cannot guarantee the effectiveness of practical application. Method The theory of social computing and parallel systems is proposed based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP). The ACP methodology plays an essential role in modeling and control of complex systems. A virtual artificial society is constructed to connect the virtual and the real world through parallel management. On the basis of the existing facts, artificial system is used to model the behavior of complex systems by using advanced computing experiments and then analyze its behavior and interact with reality to obtain a better operating system than reality. To address the bottleneck of deep learning in the field of computer vision, this paper proposes parallel vision, a visual analysis framework based on parallel learning. Parallel vision is an intelligent visual perception framework that is an extension of the ACP methodology into the computer vision field. In the framework of parallel vision, large-scale realistic artificial images can be obtained easily to give support to the vision algorithm with enough well-labeled image data. In this way, the computer can be turned into a \"laboratory\" of computational intelligence. First, the artificial image system simulates the imaging conditions that may appear in the actual image, uses the internal parameters of the system to automatically obtain the annotation information, and obtains the required artificial images. Then, we use the predictive learning method to design the visual perception model, and then we use the computational experiment method to conduct experiments. Various experiments are conducted on a rich supply of image data generated in the artificial image system. Studying the influence of difficult scenes such as complex environmental conditions on the visual perception model is convenient; thus, some uncontrollable factors in practice can be transformed into controllable factors, and the interpretability of the visual model is increased. Finally, we use prescriptive learning method to optimize model parameters. The difficulty of the visual perception model in the actual scene can be used to guide the model training in the artificial scene. We learn and optimize the visual perception model online through virtual-real interaction. This paper also conducted an application case study to preliminarily demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This case can work over synthetic images with accurate annotations and real images without any labels. The virtual-real interaction guides the model to learn useful information from synthetic data while keeping consistent with real data. We first analyze the data distribution discrepancy from a probabilistic perspective and divide it into image-level and instance-level discrepancies. Then, we design two components to align these discrepancies, i.e., global-level alignment and local-level alignment. Furthermore, a consistency alignment component is proposed to encourage the consistency between the global-level and the local-level alignment components. Result We evaluate the proposed approach on the real Cityscapes dataset by adapting from virtual SYNTHIA(synthetic collection of imagery and annotations), Virtual KITTI(Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute), and VIPER(visual perception benchmark) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Parallel vision is an important research direction in the field of visual computing. Through combination with deep learning, more and more intelligent vision systems will be developed and applied.",

The problem is important in reducing traffic congestion, improving public transportation efficiency, and facilitating urban planning. However, solving this problem is challenging due to the strong spatial dependencies of traffic patterns and the complex relations between the traffic and urban conditions. In this paper, we tackle the challenges by proposing a novel Complex-Condition-Controlled Urban Traffic Estimation through Generative Adversarial Networks (C3-GAN) for urban traffic estimation of a region under various complex conditions. C3-GAN features the following three novel designs on top of standard cGAN model: (1) an embedding network mapping the complex conditions to a latent space to find representations of the urban conditions; (2) an inference network to enhance the relations between the embedded latent vectors and the traffic data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our C3-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness.

To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction. In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen. An unsupervised adversarial loss is also employed in the network to minimize the difference between generated synthetic and original data in the training process. Experiments on real datasets indicate that the data generated by Airgen could significantly increase the prediction accuracy performed by deep learning models. The mean square error (MSE) is remarkably reduced from 0.024 to 0.015.",

To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction.",
        "contribution":"In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen. An unsupervised adversarial loss is also employed in the network to minimize the difference between generated synthetic and original data in the training process. Experiments on real datasets indicate that the data generated by Airgen could significantly increase the prediction accuracy performed by deep learning models. The mean square error (MSE) is remarkably reduced from 0.024 to 0.015.",

Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.",

Effective urban planning can help to mitigate the operational and social vulnerability of a urban system, such as high tax, crimes, traffic congestion and accidents, pollution, depression, and anxiety. Due to the high complexity of urban systems, such tasks are mostly completed by professional planners. But, human planners take longer time. The recent advance of deep learning motivates us to ask: can machines learn at a human capability to automatically and quickly calculate land-use configuration, so human planners can finally adjust machine-generated plans for specific needs? To this end, we formulate the automated urban planning problem into a task of learning to configure land-uses, given the surrounding spatial contexts. To set up the task, we define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor, where each channel is a category of POIs and the value of an entry is the number of POIs. The objective is then to propose an adversarial learning framework that can automatically generate such tensor for an unplanned area. In particular, we first characterize the contexts of surrounding areas of an unplanned area by learning representations from spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data. Second, we combine each unplanned area and its surrounding context representation as a tuple, and categorize all the tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Third, we develop an adversarial land-use configuration approach, where the surrounding context representation is fed into a generator to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish among positive and negative samples. Finally, we devise two new measurements to evaluate the quality of land-use configurations and present extensive experiment and visualization results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

In the last decade, the extensive geolocated user trajectories collected from mobile devices allowed for more realistic mobility modelling, improving its accuracy. However, mobility data sharing raises privacy concerns, which in turn limits accessibility to the data. In this paper, we propose a WHO-WHERE-WHEN (3W) model, an improved privacy-protective mobility modelling method for synthetic mobility data generation. Based on real trajectories, it produces artificial user mobility trajectories that simulate population fluctuations in a study area, and thus preserves the individual's privacy. The model simulates the individual spatiotemporal aspects of lives accurately, representing real population flows and distributions. The proposed method was inspired by the Work and Home Extracted REgions (WHERE) algorithm, but we have extended it by considering the activity space and circadian rhythm of people. Furthermore, we propose a clustering approach to capture and reproduce the heterogeneous characteristic of mobility. We evaluate our model and compare its performance to the WHERE algorithm on the synthetic and real data test cases. Use of the 3W model improved the accuracy of population distribution reproduction by 35% measured using Earth Mover's Distance. The travel distances and the spatial distribution of the flows reproduced by the 3W model match input data with high accuracy. We also evaluate the level of privacy protection by comparing synthesised and input datasets.

        "contribution":"This study is the first, purely data-driven technique to assess the classical urban climatological problem of the relation between urban heat island (UHI) and urban rainfall modification. Urban areas affect regional climate. This knowledge is based on studies involving observations or process-scale models.

        "abstract":"The social function of areas of interest (AOIs) is crucial to the identification of urban functional zoning and land use classification, which has been a hot topic in various fields such as urban planning and smart city fields. Most existing studies on urban functional zoning and land use classification either largely rely on low-frequency remote sensing images, which are constrained to the block level due to their spatial scale limitation, or suffer from low accuracy and high uncertainty when using dynamic data, such as social media and traffic data. This paper proposes an hour-day-spectrum (HDS) approach for generating six types of distribution waveforms of taxi pick-up and drop-off points which serve as interpretation indicators of the social functions of AOIs. To achieve this goal, we first performed fine-grained cleaning of the drop-off points to eliminate the spatial errors caused by taxi drivers. Next, buffer and spatial clustering were integrated to explore the associations between travel behavior and AOIs. Third, the identification of AOI types was made by using the standard HDS method combined with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Finally, some matching tests were carried out by similarity indexes of a standard HDS and sample HDS, i.e., the Gaussian kernel function and Pearson coefficient, to ensure matching accuracy. The experiment was conducted in the Chongchuan and Gangzha Districts, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. By training 50 AOI samples, six types of standard HDS of residential districts, schools, hospitals, and shopping malls were obtained. Then, 108 AOI samples were tested, and the overall accuracy was found to be 90.74%. This approach generates value-added services of the taxi trajectory and provides a continuous update and fine-grained supplementary method for the identification of land use types. In addition, the approach is object-oriented and based on AOIs, and can be combined with image interpretation and other methods to improve the identification effect.",

        "introduction":"The social function of areas of interest (AOIs) is crucial to the identification of urban functional zoning and land use classification, which has been a hot topic in various fields such as urban planning and smart city fields. Most existing studies on urban functional zoning and land use classification either largely rely on low-frequency remote sensing images, which are constrained to the block level due to their spatial scale limitation, or suffer from low accuracy and high uncertainty when using dynamic data, such as social media and traffic data.",
        "contribution":"This paper proposes an hour-day-spectrum (HDS) approach for generating six types of distribution waveforms of taxi pick-up and drop-off points which serve as interpretation indicators of the social functions of AOIs. To achieve this goal, we first performed fine-grained cleaning of the drop-off points to eliminate the spatial errors caused by taxi drivers. Next, buffer and spatial clustering were integrated to explore the associations between travel behavior and AOIs. Third, the identification of AOI types was made by using the standard HDS method combined with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Finally, some matching tests were carried out by similarity indexes of a standard HDS and sample HDS, i.e., the Gaussian kernel function and Pearson coefficient, to ensure matching accuracy. The experiment was conducted in the Chongchuan and Gangzha Districts, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. By training 50 AOI samples, six types of standard HDS of residential districts, schools, hospitals, and shopping malls were obtained. Then, 108 AOI samples were tested, and the overall accuracy was found to be 90.74%. This approach generates value-added services of the taxi trajectory and provides a continuous update and fine-grained supplementary method for the identification of land use types. In addition, the approach is object-oriented and based on AOIs, and can be combined with image interpretation and other methods to improve the identification effect.",

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised sample collection method for mapping urban areas using Landsat imagery. Specifically, the idea is to select reliable, representative, and diverse training samples from the images in a two-stage and iterative manner, based on a set of spectral indices (vegetation, impervious surface, soil, water). To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, a synthetic data set was designed and a series of Landsat images over 39 representative cities from different biomes across the world was employed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was quantitatively validated by assessing the quality of the automatically collected samples and the accuracy of the mapping results. In terms of the mapping performance, the proposed automatic approach can achieve a comparable mapping accuracy to supervised classification with manually collected samples.

The model consists of four parts: a geospatial partition, a Markov chain (MC), a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), and cellular automata (CA). This study employed multivariate land use data for the period 2000\u20132015 to conduct spatial clustering for the Ganjingzi District and to simulate landscape status evolution via a divisional composite cellular automaton model. During the period of 2000\u20132015, construction land and forest land areas in Ganjingzi District increased by 19.43% and 15.19%, respectively, whereas farmland, garden lands, and other land areas decreased by 43.42%, 52.14%, and 75.97%, respectively. Land use conversion potentials in different sub-regions show different characteristics in space. The overall land-change prediction accuracy for the subarea-composite model is 3% higher than that of the non-partitioned model, and misses are reduced by 3.1%. Therefore, by integrating geospatial zoning and the MLP-ANN hybrid method, the land type conversion rules of different zonings can be obtained, allowing for more effective simulations of future urban land use change. The hybrid cellular automata model developed here will provide a reference for urban planning and policy formulation.",

Macro-level traffic safety studies have been carried out extensively in many countries, but to date, few have been conducted in China. This study developed a macro-level safety model for 263 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) within the urban area of Shanghai in order to examine the relationship between traffic crash frequency and road network, traffic, socio-economic characteristics, and land use features. To account for the spatial correlations among TAZs, a Bayesian conditional autoregressive negative binomial model was estimated, linking crash frequencies in each TAZ to several independent variables. Modeling results showed that higher crash frequencies are associated with greater populations, road densities, total length of major and minor arterials, trip frequencies, and with shorter intersection spacing. The results from this study can help transportation planners and managers identify the crash contributing factors, and can lead to the development of improved safety planning and management.",
