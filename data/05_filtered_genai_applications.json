For smart city management, LLM-based multi-agent systems achieve 94\u201399% accuracy in routing urban queries and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality (G-Eval scores of 0.68\u20130.74) compared to standalone LLMs (0.30\u20130.38). Achievement of high scores in routing queries and response accuracy is possible with middle-size LLM models rather than the biggest LLM models. What is the implication of the main findings? The multi-agent LLM approach enables efficient processing of complex urban planning tasks while maintaining high relevance in responses, making it practical for real-world city management applications. LLM agents can effectively augment human decision making in urban planning by reducing task completion time from days to hours while maintaining accuracy and accountability in complex scenarios. This study investigates the implementation of LLM agents in smart city management, leveraging both the inherent language processing abilities of LLMs and the distributed problem solving capabilities of multi-agent systems for the improvement of urban decision making processes. A multi-agent system architecture combines LLMs with existing urban information systems to process complex queries and generate contextually relevant responses for urban planning and management. The research is focused on three main hypotheses testing: (1) LLM agents\u2019 capability for effective routing and processing diverse urban queries, (2) the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology in improving response accuracy when working with local knowledge and regulations, and (3) the impact of integrating LLM agents with existing urban information systems. Our experimental results, based on a comprehensive validation dataset of 150 question\u2013answer pairs, demonstrate significant improvements in decision support capabilities. The multi-agent system achieved pipeline selection accuracy of 94\u201399% across different models, while the integration of RAG technology improved response accuracy by 17% for strategic development queries and 55% for service accessibility questions. The combined use of document databases and service APIs resulted in the highest performance metrics (G-Eval scores of 0.68\u20130.74) compared to standalone LLM responses (0.30\u20130.38). Using St. Petersburg\u2019s Digital Urban Platform as a testbed, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach to create integrated city management systems with support complex urban decision making processes. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced urban management by providing empirical evidence of LLM agents\u2019 effectiveness in processing heterogeneous urban data and supporting strategic planning decisions. Our findings suggest that LLM-based multi-agent systems can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of urban decision making while maintaining high relevance in responses.",

The developed AI framework is effective when grounded on five core technical capabilities with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automated agentic AI that feeds into human-in-the-loop processes. The framework provides a prototypical setting for university cities of the future to provide direction, guidance, and standards for sustainable and safe smart cities of the future.

These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and\/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners. This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals.

This study introduces an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address this challenge, presenting a novel framework for the simulation and mitigation of advanced network attacks, particularly focusing on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and spoofing attacks which pose significant threats in IoT environments. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), comprising two neural networks-the generator and the discriminator compete in a game-theoretic scenario, facilitating a deep understanding of attack patterns through the generation of realistic, synthetic cyber-attack scenarios. This research exploits GANs to bridge the gap between the static nature of traditional security protocols and the dynamic, evolving landscape of cyber threats. By training on a comprehensive dataset of known attacks and normal network activities, our proposed model, the Dynamic Adaptive Threat Simulation GAN (DATS-GAN), is capable of producing varied and realistic attack scenarios. These simulations serve a dual purpose: they not only enhance the detection capabilities and responsiveness of current security systems but also provide a basis for the development of new, adaptive security mechanisms capable of dynamically responding to the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. The effectiveness of DATS-GAN is demonstrated through extensive empirical analysis, highlighting significant improvements in the detection precision and reaction times of security frameworks within WSNs. Moreover, the generated synthetic attack scenarios provide a valuable resource for training machine learning models, leading to the advancement of adaptive security solutions that maintain a high readiness level against emerging cyber threats. The outcomes of this research hold substantial promise for the cyber security domain, showcasing the potential of GANs to revolutionize network defenses against sophisticated cyber threats in IoT and WSN environments.",

Previous research mainly focuses on network models tailored to specific degradation types, while recent unified frameworks and foundation models still face critical challenges in temporal consistency, automated degradation recognition, and detail preservation. Despite recent advances in foundation models, current approaches rely heavily on predefined degradation labels and remain focused on image-level operations, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios and struggling with preserving fine-grained details. To address these challenges, we propose Grid Splicing Diffusion Model (GSDiff), a general framework for video reconstruction that leverages a novel grid splicing execution alongside instruction-tuned Large Language Model (LLM). GSDiff introduces three key innovative modules: (1) a LLM-driven degradation recognition module that enables automatic and fine-grained restoration guidance through zero-shot degradation analysis, (2) a Grid Splicing Module that organizes multiple frames into a unified grid structure to facilitate spatiotemporal feature processing, and (3) a Detail Preservation Module integrated with a Tail Refine Network to enhance fine-grained details during diffusion and post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSDiff delivers state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including deraining, desnowing, denoising, and deblurring, propelling advancements in medical diagnostics and smart city applications.",

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce richly descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. However, most current RSIC models generally apply only fine-tuning to these datasets without developing models tailored to the unique characteristics of remote sensing imagery. This paper proposes RS-MoE, the first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design.

Limitations include a lack of deep learning applications in extracting public art elements, limited exploration of cultural integration, and insufficient focus on interactive design methods. Method: The proposed Great Cane Rat Algorithm-Tuned Scalable Generative Adversarial Network (GCR-SGAN) optimizes SGAN performance using GCRO for generating high-quality public art designs. The dataset includes images of public art, featuring murals, sculptures, and design elements for training and analysis.

The proposed work integrates SGAN for generating high-quality public art designs with GCR optimization to enhance GAN training, improving convergence stability, generation quality, and scalability for effective art design generation and analysis. Results: The results demonstrate that the GCR-SGAN model had accuracy of 0,98, which efficiently generates high-quality public art designs, optimizing both visual appeal and training stability. Conclusion: The approach effectively advances the generation of diverse, scalable art for real-world applications.

Person re-identification (ReID) is an essential technology for building smart cities, with significant implications for security monitoring and criminal investigation applications. The goal of person re-identification is to accurately identify specific individuals captured under different cameras.

To address this challenge, we introduce a more complex and diverse synthetic dataset with easy-to-obtain labels for auxiliary training, and propose a novel camera-aware asymmetric adversarial learning (CAAL) method that overcomes intra-class variation among multiple cameras and the domain-shift between real data and synthetic data, enabling the learning of camera-invariant feature representations from diverse data sources. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of misleading information carried by synthetic datasets and prevent the model from overfitting to synthetic data during adversarial training, we propose using an auxiliary network trained on real-world data to constrain the training of the backbone network.

While supervised learning methods in change detection have demonstrated substantial efficacy, they are often hindered by the rising costs associated with data annotation. Semi-supervised methods have attracted increasing interest, offering promising results with limited data labeling.

However, they usually face the problems of insufficient data augmentation and unbalanced quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling. To address the above problems, we propose a semi-supervised change detection method with data augmentation and adaptive threshold updating (DA-AT) for high-resolution remote sensing images. Firstly, a channel-level data augmentation (CLDA) technique is designed to enhance the strong augmentation effect and improve consistency regularization so as to address the problem of insufficient feature representation. Secondly, an adaptive threshold (AT) is proposed to dynamically adjust the threshold during the training process to balance the quality and quantity of pseudo-labeling so as to optimize the self-training process. Finally, an adaptive class weight (ACW) mechanism is proposed to alleviate the impact of the imbalance between the changed classes and the unchanged classes, which effectively enhances the learning ability of the model for the changed classes.

The proposed method integrates generative adversarial networks with ResNet, ResNeXt, and DenseNet to construct an adversarial hybrid neural network, aiming to tackle the challenges of encrypted traffic detection. On this basis, a reconstructive domain adaptation module is introduced to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain, thereby enhancing cross-domain detection capabilities.

As a result, optimizing energy usage is a significant challenge for WSN-assisted applications. To address this, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Routing and Cluster Head Selection in Wireless Sensor Network through an Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network for Golden Search Optimization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Network (EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA). This method involves selecting the Cluster Head (CH) using Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network (ADRGAN), minimizing energy consumption, and reducing a number of dead sensor nodes. Subsequently, Golden Search Optimization Algorithm (GSOA) is employed to determine an optimal path for data transmission to the sink node, maximizing energy efficiency, and elongating sensor node lifespan. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA method is simulated in MATLAB. The performance metrics, such as network lifetime, number of alive nodes, number of dead nodes, throughput, energy consumption, and packet delivery ratio is examined. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA demonstrates improved performance, achieving a higher average throughput of 0.93 Mbps, and lower average energy consumption of 0.39 mJ compared with the existing methods. These improvements have significant real-world implications for enhancing the efficiency and longevity of WSNs in applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and industrial automation.",

With Human-Centered AI in mind, we aim to help architects quickly revise their ideas by easily switching between 2D sketches and 3D models, allowing for smoother iteration and sharing of ideas. Inspired by feedback from architects and existing workflows, our system takes as a first input a user sketch of multiple buildings in a top-down view. The user then draws a perspective sketch of the envisioned site. Our method is designed to exploit the complementarity of information in the two sketches and allows users to quickly preview and adjust the inferred 3D shapes. Our model has two main components. First, we propose a novel sketch-to-depth prediction network for perspective sketches that exploits top-down sketch shapes. Second, we use depth cues derived from the perspective sketch as a condition to our diffusion model, which ultimately completes the geometry in a top-down view. Thus, our final 3D geometry is represented as a heightfield, allowing users to construct the city \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d. The code, datasets, and interface are available at visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk\/pubs\/groundup.",

A pre-trained object detection model i.e., Grounding DINO, is implemented to efficiently identify buildings. A novel manually labeled training data of detected buildings corresponding to their usage is used to extract features from building facades across diverse Indian cities (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi) using Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

We then leverage GPT-3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), fine-tuned with a specifically designed few-shot prompting method, to infer building usage from the recognized text. To achieve optimal performance, the proposed ensemble linear metaclassifier combines predictions from ViT and LLM model. The predicted building usages are attributed to their corresponding locations to develop spatial maps. An analysis of our framework compared against ground truth data collected from various Indian cities reveals significantly accurate outcomes.

The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately captures passengers\u2019 travel patterns in both the temporal and spatial dimensions, offering technical support for urban transportation planning.",

This approach can enhance cities by improving air quality, reducing emissions, and boosting public health and safety through physical activity and accident prevention.

This study investigates an innovative simulation-based multi-agent system within a virtual reality framework that replicates the real-world environment. The framework is populated by automated 'digital citizens,' simulating complex social structures and interactions to examine and optimize AI. Application of various theories from the fields of sociology, social psychology, computer science, physics, biology, and economics demonstrates the possibility of a more human-aligned and socially responsible AI. The purpose of such a digital environment is to provide a dynamic platform where advanced AI agents can interact and make independent decisions, thereby mimicking realistic scenarios. The actors in this digital city, operated by the LLMs, serve as the primary agents, exhibiting high degrees of autonomy. While this approach shows immense potential, there are notable challenges and limitations, most significantly the unpredictable nature of real-world social dynamics.

Due to the rapid development and wide application of LLMs, challenges such as ethical alignment, controllability, and predictability of these models emerged as global risks. This study investigates an innovative simulation-based multi-agent system within a virtual reality framework that replicates the real-world environment. The framework is populated by automated 'digital citizens,' simulating complex social structures and interactions to examine and optimize AI. Application of various theories from the fields of sociology, social psychology, computer science, physics, biology, and economics demonstrates the possibility of a more human-aligned and socially responsible AI. The purpose of such a digital environment is to provide a dynamic platform where advanced AI agents can interact and make independent decisions, thereby mimicking realistic scenarios. The actors in this digital city, operated by the LLMs, serve as the primary agents, exhibiting high degrees of autonomy. While this approach shows immense potential, there are notable challenges and limitations, most significantly the unpredictable nature of real-world social dynamics.

Traditional OD prediction models, while effective within single cities, often face limitations when applied across different cities due to varied traffic conditions, urban layouts, and socio-economic factors. In this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs.

Therefore, we design a novel end-to-end diffusion model to generate online maps directly from remote sensing images, called MapGen-Diff. We leverage a strategy inspired by Brownian motion to make a trade-off between the diversity and the accuracy of generation process. Meanwhile, an image compression module is proposed to map the raw images into the latent space for capturing more perception features. In order to enhance the geometric accuracy of ground features, a consistency regularization is designed, which allows the model to generate maps with clearer boundaries and colorization. Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed MapGen-Diff achieves outstanding performance, especially a (Formula presented.) RMSE and (Formula presented.) SSIM improvement on Los Angeles and Toronto datasets. The visualization results also demonstrate more accurate local details and higher quality.",

Given the large size, complex target features, and abundant details of remote sensing images, along with the need for efficient information acquisition, we propose a Diffusion Super-Resolution (DSR) algorithm based on a conditional diffusion model. This approach uses low-resolution remote sensing images from the same region as conditioning inputs to the diffusion model, while high-resolution images with added noise are concatenated as inputs. A deep noise training network was constructed with U-Net as the backbone, incorporating residual connections and self-attention mechanisms. The loss function was also improved for better super-resolution results. The DSR method was tested using high-resolution remote sensing images from multiple periods of the domestic Gaofen and SuperView satellite series. The super-resolution results demonstrated pixel dimension expansion from 32 to 128. Comparative experiments with Bicubic, SRGAN, Real-ESRGAN, and SwinIR super-resolution algorithms showed that the DSR method outperforms these algorithms in both PSNR and SSIM metrics. Additionally, the DSR method significantly improves the quality of multispectral remote sensing images. By leveraging the conditional diffusion model, it successfully preserves rich detail and enhances spatial resolution without compromising image clarity. This method offers an efficient solution for super-resolution reconstruction, ensuring effective information acquisition in remote sensing applications and fulfilling the requirements of various domains such as land use classification, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. Moreover, the DSR method also opens new avenues for future research by demonstrating the potential of diffusion models in remote sensing image processing. It overcomes the limitations of simple convolutional networks, which extract only shallow features, and avoids the convergence issues commonly seen in adversarial neural networks during training, ultimately improving the restoration of rich details in remote sensing images.",

The authors apply an AI-based methodology, particularly Large Language Models of OpenAI ChatGPT-3 and Google Bard as AI experts, to uniquely evaluate 26 criteria that represent SB services across five SC infrastructure domains (energy, mobility, water, waste management, and security), emphasizing their contributions to the integration of SB into SC and quantifying their impact on the efficiency, resilience, and environmental sustainability of SC. The framework was then validated through two rounds of the Delphi method, leveraging human expert knowledge and an iterative consensus-building process. The framework\u2019s efficiency in analyzing complicated information and generating important insights is demonstrated via five case studies. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the effects of SB services on SC infrastructure domains, highlighting the intricate nature of SC, as well as revealing areas that require further integration to realize the SC performance objectives.",

In this paper, we target a new task called function-aware urban layout regeneration, and propose UrbanEvolver, a function-aware deep generative model for the task. Given a target region to be regenerated, our model outputs a regenerated urban layout (i.e., roads and buildings) for the target region by considering the function (i.e., land use type) of the target region and its surrounding context (i.e., the functions and urban layouts of the surrounding regions). UrbanEvolver first extracts implicit regeneration rules from the target function and the surrounding context by encoding them separately in different scales through the function-layout adaptive (FA) blocks, and then constrains the regenerated urban layout based on the learned regeneration rules. To enforce the regenerated layout to be valid and to follow the road structure, we design a set of losses covering both pixel-level and geometry-level constraints. To train our model, we collect a large-scale urban layout dataset covering more than 147 K regions under 1300 km2 with rich annotations, including functions, region shapes, urban road layouts, and urban building layouts.

HamNet emphasizes the importance of historical crime data via a Gated-based History Fusion (GHF) module and adaptively controls multimodal conditions to be fused across different diffusion time steps via a Time step-Aware Modality Fusion (TAMF) module. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffCrime, which outperforms baselines by at least 43% and 31% in terms of RMSE, respectively.",

Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes. The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources. The results show that contextual feedback performed better overall, with significant improvements in the pragmatic and hedonic quality, attractiveness, reuse intention, feeling that the complaint is taken seriously, and the citizens' trust in their municipality.",

In the domain of visible and infrared image fusion, object vanishment after fusion is a key problem which restricts the fusion performance. To address this problem, a novel Salient Regional Generative Adversarial Network GAN (SaReGAN) is presented for infrared and VIS image fusion. The SaReGAN consists of three parts. In the first part, the salient regions of infrared image are extracted by visual saliency map and the information of these regions is preserved. In the second part, the VIS image, infrared image and salient information are merged thoroughly in the generator to gain a pre-fused image.

In the domain of visible and infrared image fusion, object vanishment after fusion is a key problem which restricts the fusion performance.

In the first part, the salient regions of infrared image are extracted by visual saliency map and the information of these regions is preserved.

Then, we used the trained model as the generator to synthesize road images conditioned in a geospatial context. Finally, we converted the generated road images into road networks with several post-processes. The experiments conducted in five cities of the United States showed that our model can generate reasonable road networks, maintaining the layouts and styles of real examples. Moreover, our model has the ability to show the obstructive effect of geographic barriers on urban roads. By comparing models with different context factors as input, we find that the model that considers all four factors generally performs the best.

This study introduces a novel approach for the multivariate prediction of hydrological variables, specifically focusing on water level forecasts for two hydrological stations along the Atrato River in Colombia. The model, utilizing a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, integrates data from hydrological variables, such as the flow, precipitation, and level. With a model architecture featuring four inputs and two outputs, where flow and precipitation serve as inputs and the level serves as the output for each station, the LSTM model is adept at capturing the complex dynamics and cross-correlations among these variables.

        "abstract":"With the artificial intelligence technology development boom, large language models are demonstrating their potential in comprehension and creativity. Large language models such as GPT-4 and Gemini have been able to powerfully study for various professional-level exams. However, as a language model itself, its powerful comprehension can only be reflected in text sequences. Currently, although videos can be generated through the connection between 3D point clouds and large language models, there is currently no prompt project that directly interacts with one-dimensional through attribute calculation results. The point cloud data is also rich in information that can support various tasks of urban construction. For scene-level point cloud data, there has been a lot of research done on semantic segmentation, target detection, and other tasks. However, it is usually difficult to provide direct help to scene construction from the perception results. This paper presents a method for applying large language models to urban ecological construction by combining the results of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. The objective is to integrate the prior knowledge and creative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within urban development with the outcomes derived from point cloud semantic segmentation results. This integration aims to establish an interactive point cloud intelligent analysis system, tailored for aiding decision-making processes in urban ecological civilization construction, thus presenting innovative perspectives for the advancement of smart city development.",

        "abstract":"In recent years, the application of the internet of things (IoT) in areas such as intelligent transportation, smart cities, and the industrial internet has become increasingly widespread. As a crucial supporting infrastructure, IoT devices are utilized in various fields to construct IoT networks. However, due to the inherent limitations of IoT devices, such as limited computing resources and low memory capacity, security concerns have become increasingly prominent. Among these concerns are Denial-of-Service (DoS) and botnet attacks, which are difficult to prevent due to their large-scale and covert nature. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid DoS Attack Intrusion Detection System (HDA-IDS) that combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to effectively identify both known and unknown DoS\/botnet attacks. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel anomaly-based detection model called CL-GAN. It integrates CNN-LSTM with GAN to establish a baseline for normal behavior and detect malicious traffic. In contrast to other semi-supervised models, the CL-GAN exhibits superior accuracy, as well as shorter training and testing times, in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that the HDA-IDS outperforms other IDSs in detecting DoS and botnet attacks. When tested on datasets such as NSL-KDD, CICIDS2018, and Bot-IoT, the HDA-IDS achieved an average of 5% overall improvement superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other works. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in addressing security issues in IoT networks, and presents a general framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale attacks constructed through the dissemination of false information.",

However, gathering and disseminating mobility data face challenges such as data collection, handling of missing information, and privacy protection.

Thus, we propose MobDeep, a unified framework to compare and evaluate generative models of time series based on mobility data features, which considers statistical and deep learning-based modeling. To achieve its goal, MobDeep receives as input statistical or Generative Adversarial Network-based models (GANs) and the raw mobility data, and outputs synthetic data and the metrics comparing the synthetic with the original data. In such way, MobDeep allows evaluating synthetic datasets through qualitative and quantitative metrics. As a proof-of-concept, MobDeep implements one classical statistical model (ARIMA) and three GANs models. To demonstrate MobDeep on distinct mobility scenarios, we considered an open dataset containing information about bicycle rentals in US cities and a private dataset containing information about a Brazilian metropolis\u2019s urban traffic.

Energy theft is a big problem for smart meters and causes non-technical losses. Energy theft attacks can be launched by malicious consumers by compromising the smart meters to report manipulated consumption data for less billing. It is a global issue causing technical and financial damage to governments and operators. Deep learning-based techniques can effectively identify consumers involved in energy theft through power consumption data.

We employed CNN for feature extraction and traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. In this work, honest data were obtained from a real dataset. Six attack vectors causing data tampering were utilized. Tampered data were synthetically generated through these attack vectors. Six separate datasets were created for each attack vector to design a specialized detector tailored for that specific attack. Additionally, a dataset containing all attack vectors was also generated for the purpose of designing a general detector. Furthermore, the imbalanced dataset problem was addressed through the application of the generative adversarial network (GAN) method.

Unlike previous works focused on the generation of single objects or indoor scenes, the huge volumes of spatial data in cities pose a challenge to the generative models. Furthermore, few publicly available 3D real-world city datasets also hinder the development of methods for city generation. In this paper, we first collect over 3,000,000 geo-referenced objects for the cities of New York, Zurich, Tokyo, Berlin, Boston, and several other large cities. Based on this dataset, we propose AETree, a tree-structured auto-encoder neural network, for city generation. Specifically, we first propose a novel Spatial-Geometric Distance (SGD) metric to measure the similarity between building layouts and then construct a binary tree over the raw geometric data of the building based on the SGD metric. Next, we present a tree-structured network whose encoder learns to extract and merge spatial information from the bottom-up iteratively. The resulting global representation is reversely decoded for reconstruction or generation. To address the issue of long-dependency as the level of the tree increases, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Cell is employed as a basic network element of the proposed AETree. Moreover, we introduce a novel metric, Overlapping Area Ratio (OAR), to quantitatively evaluate the generation results. Experiments on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline models, such as LayoutTransformer and LayoutVAE, in terms of key metrics. Specifically, the proposed model achieves a Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence (JSD) of 0.0033, compared to 0.0041 and 0.0061 for LayoutTransformer and LayoutVAE, respectively. Similarly, for the Overall Accuracy Rate (OAR), the proposed model scores 1.66, significantly better than 28.24 and 19.01 for the baseline models Furthermore, the latent features learned by AETree can serve downstream urban planning applications.

Using a structured narrative review method with a critical approach, the study highlights AI\u2019s versatility in analyzing complex social phenomena, understanding human behavior, and optimizing urban infrastructure. With its unique socio-cultural challenges, Saudi Arabia aims for sustainable development through Saudi Vision 2030 and various smart city projects, emphasizing the importance of addressing challenges like gender equality, cultural preservation, an increasing youth population, rapid urbanization, and climate change. The study identifies ten AI applications and models to address these challenges and promote relevant SDGs across six areas: Predictive Analytics and Forecasting, Optimization and Decision Support, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Geospatial AI. These AI models can help address issues like gender equality, youth education, and employment, as well as optimize water management, energy use, and urban planning to address rapid urbanization and climate change challenges. By aligning AI development with the goals outlined in the SDGs, Saudi Arabia can unlock the potential of AI to create sustainable, resilient, and inclusive smart cities that effectively address socio-cultural challenges. However, the study emphasizes the necessity of customizing AI applications in smart cities based on Saudi Arabia\u2019s religious and cultural values to ensure ethical and culturally sensitive implementations. The findings of this study hold relevance not only for Saudi Arabia but also for other countries facing similar challenges.

This paper presents an AI-driven framework to optimize urban and vertical agriculture planning by leveraging advanced machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), and Large Language Models (LLM). The proposed framework integrates diverse dataset that includes as socioeconomic data, geographic information, and urban zoning regulations to provide actionable insights for decision-makers. The Spiking Neural Network model demon-strated superior predictive accuracy in identifying optimal sites for urban agriculture by effectively handling complex patterns and temporal dynamics in the data. Additionally, the integration of an LLM-powered chatbot into a user-friendly web application enhances interactivity and supports real-time decision-making, guiding users through the prediction process with context-specific recommendations. Experimental results validate the robustness and scalability of the framework across various urban settings, demonstrating its potential to transform urban agriculture practices by providing precise, data-driven recommendations. The findings of this study highlight the transformative potential of AI in urban planning and agriculture, offering a novel approach to fostering sustainable urban development and food security.

The Advanced Intelligent Traffic Management System (AITMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to address the persistent challenges of traffic congestion, poor traffic management, and air pollution in densely populated urban areas. Current traffic management systems often rely on static algorithms and predetermined signal timings, which are insufficient to handle dynamic and unpredictable traffic patterns. This results in prolonged travel times, increased fuel consumption, and elevated levels of air pollution, posing serious threats to public health and environmental sustainability. AITMS integrates physical and digital infrastructures, leveraging Generative AI for real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making. By incorporating sensors, IoT devices, and advanced data analytics, the system can predict traffic flow, optimize signal timings, and recommend alternate routes. It also communicates with connected vehicles to provide real-time updates. The incorporation of Generative AI enables the AITMS to continually adapt and learn from new data inputs and trends, ensuring sustainability and scalability in urban transportation. AITMS is an innovative framework enhanced by Generative AI, aimed at revolutionizing urban traffic management in smart cities.

This results in prolonged travel times, increased fuel consumption, and elevated levels of air pollution, posing serious threats to public health and environmental sustainability. AITMS integrates physical and digital infrastructures, leveraging Generative AI for real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making. By incorporating sensors, IoT devices, and advanced data analytics, the system can predict traffic flow, optimize signal timings, and recommend alternate routes. It also communicates with connected vehicles to provide real-time updates. The incorporation of Generative AI enables the AITMS to continually adapt and learn from new data inputs and trends, ensuring sustainability and scalability in urban transportation. AITMS is an innovative framework enhanced by Generative AI, aimed at revolutionizing urban traffic management in smart cities. Similar frameworks demonstrate promising outcomes, including improved traffic management, reduced congestion, and enhanced driver safety. AITMS aims to transform urban transportation, elevate residents' quality of life, and foster more sustainable and resilient cities amidst urbanization challenges.",

The paper explains how GenAI can be used for urban analysis applications from an information management perspective. It presents examples of the operations that can be achieved. Additionally, it describes studies related to energy and resource management, urban planning, natural disaster management, and traffic management, demonstrating the advantages of applying this type of technology. The use of GenAI, along with Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIS&T) and Smart Cities concepts and tools, is being discussed. It presents some points to consider when designing, developing, and implementing GenAI-based applications for urban space analysis.",

Traditional methods, such as face-based and fingerprint-based authentication, usually incur high costs to be installed in all this kind of environments. In this paper, we develop a ubiquitous low-effort user authentication approach, mmPalm, based on palm recognition using millimeter wave (mmWave) signals. mmWave technology has been adopted by WiGig and 5G, making mmPalm a low-cost solution that can be widely adopted in public places. In addition, the high resolution of mmWave signals allows mmPalm to extract detailed palm characteristics (e.g., palm geometry, skin thickness, and texture) that can assemble distinctive palmprints for user authentication. Our innovative virtual antennas design further increases the spatial resolution of a commercial mmWave device, enabling it to fully capture the comprehensive palmprint features. Moreover, to address the challenge of small-scale environmental changes (e.g., variations in palm-device distances and palm orientations), we design a novel palm profile augmentation method, utilizing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic palm profiles for mitigating palm instability. Furthermore, we design a cross-environment adaptation framework based on transfer learning to address the challenge of large-scale environmental changes, including multipath variations introduced by human bodies and nearby furniture. Extensive experiments with 30 participants through 6 months demonstrate that mmPalm achieves 99% authentication accuracy with resilience against different types of attacks, including random, impersonation, and counterfeit.",

        "contribution":"CycleGAN, a type of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is used in this study to tackle the difficult problem of translating cityscape photographs between day and night settings. Day-to-night picture translation is changing well-lit daytime images into nocturnal landscapes using artificial lighting, unique color palettes, and atmospheric effects, and vice versa. Previously, this work required labour-intensive manual involvement or specialised picture algorithms, but deep learning and GANs have introduced automation and better quality to this industry. CycleGAN excels at unpaired picture translation, even when there are no obvious correspondences between daylight and nighttime datasets. It makes use of the idea of cycle consistency to ensure proper translation between picture domains. This study focuses on training a CycleGAN model and found encouraging results. Beyond technical aspects, this paper highlights practical applications spanning film production, gaming, urban planning, traffic management, photography, environmental impact assessment, and more. CycleGAN's adaptability offers opportunities to enhance realism, aesthetics, and decision-making across various domains. In summary, this research underscores the potential of CycleGAN in day-to-night image translation, unlocking new possibilities in visualizing urban environments and influencing diverse industries and applications.",

However, since CD labels are difficult to obtain, how to utilize semantic information in RS images to improve the change prediction performance is a problem worth exploring. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based CD method that utilizes a diffusion generation model to translate high-level semantic information into low-level change information. First, we propose a pseudo-change image pair generation method that utilizes semantic labels to guide the diffusion model to generate change images. Then, the refined loss (RL) is designed to improve the model's ability to recognize change features based on the difference between pseudo-change image pairs and unlabeled image pairs. Experimental results on WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and GoogleGZ-CD datasets show that the proposed method effectively transfers the semantic information into change information and finally improves the model's feature recognition ability for change objects.

As a result, deep learning-based methods gained popularity in recent years. This research paper proposes a novel approach to generating building and residential plans using VAE and GANs. The project started with a VAE with Dall-e, which imposed more constraints on the output image. However, this led to pixelated images that were difficult to interpret. To overcome this, GANs were used, which required fewer constraints to produce more explicit output images. In GANs, two networks are trained simultaneously, a generator network that produces new samples and a discriminator network that evaluates the quality of the generated samples.

The proposed GAN approach can overpower traditional residential plan design methods, producing accurate and high-resolution plans that are easier to interpret.

However, hyperspectral imaging usually suffers from low spatial resolution and high cost, which limits the wide application of hyperspectral data. Spectral super-resolution provides a promising solution to acquire hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution and low cost, taking RGB images as input. Existing spectral super-resolution methods utilize neural networks following a single-shot framework, i.e., final results are obtained by one-stage spectral super-resolution, which struggles to capture and model the complex relationships between spectral bands.

        "abstract":"In the context of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, such as unmanned delivery vehicles and taxis are gradually gaining acceptance. However, their application scenarios remain significantly fragmented. Typically, an Autonomous Multi-Functional Vehicle (AMFV) is not engaged in other scenarios when idle in a specific one. Currently, a unified system capable of coordinating and using these resources efficiently is lacking. Moreover, there is an absence of an advanced navigation algorithm for facilitating coordinated navigation among Heterogeneous Vehicles (HVs). To address these issues, we propose the LLM-driven Multi-vehicle Dispatching and navigation (LiMeda) framework. It comprises an LLM-driven scheduling module that facilitates efficient allocation considering task scenarios and vehicle information, which addresses the issue of incompatible vehicle resources across various smart city scenarios. And the other is a navigation module, founded on the Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework we previously proposed, which can effectively perform cooperative navigation tasks among heterogeneous agents, assisting the cooperative task completion by HVs in a smart city. Experimental results show our method outperforms both traditional scheduling algorithms and Reinforcement Learning navigation algorithms in metric terms. Additionally, it shows remarkable scalability and generalization under varying city scales, vehicle numbers, and task numbers.",

This knowledge is crucial for a variety of fields, such as meteorology and agriculture, environmental science, urban planning and construction, tourism, and cultural preservation. Currently available datasets in the field of scene change understanding primarily concentrate on two main tasks: the detection of changed regions within a scene and the linguistic description of the change content. Existing datasets focus on recognizing discrete changes, such as adding or deleting an object from two images, and largely rely on artificially generated images. Consequently, the existing change understanding methods primarily focus on identifying distinct object differences, overlooking the importance of continuous, gradual changes occurring over extended time intervals. To address the above issues, we propose a novel benchmark dataset, STVchrono, targeting the localization and description of long-term continuous changes in real-world scenes. The dataset consists of 71,900 photographs from Google Street View API taken over an 18-year span across 50 cities all over the world. Our STVchrono dataset is designed to support real-world continuous change recognition and description in both image pairs and extended image sequences, while also enabling the segmentation of changed regions. We conduct experiments to evaluate state-of-the- art methods on continuous change description and segmentation, as well as multimodal Large Language Models for describing changes. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced methods lag human performance, emphasizing the need to adapt them to continuously changing real-world scenarios.

In this study, we designed a Spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced multi-TAsk GEnerative adversarial network (GAN), named STAGE, to generate synthetic trajectories that statistically resemble the real data without recycling personal information. In STAGE, we designed a multi-task generator with three stages of spatio-temporal generation tasks, i.e. activity-sequence generation task, township-level trajectory generation task, and neighborhood-level trajectory generation task, with the last one as the main task while the other two as auxiliary tasks. Meanwhile, we designed a spatial consistency loss in the adversarial training process to assess the spatial consistency of generated trajectories at different spatial scales. Experiment results show that compared to the baselines, trajectories generated by our method have closer data distributions to the real ones. We argued that the designs of spatiotemporal-knowledge enhanced generation tasks and training loss benefit the spatiotemporal generation processes, which help reproduce the temporal patterns of human daily activities and spatial distribution of human movements.",

Despite this, data trading faces challenges like the absence of robust pricing methods and the lack of trustworthy trading mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce a traffic-oriented data trading platform named Data on The Move (DTM), integrating traffic simulation, data trading, and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents. The DTM platform supports evident-based data value evaluation and AI-based trading mechanisms. Leveraging the common sense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess traffic state and data value, DTM can determine reasonable traffic data pricing through multi-round interaction and simulations. Moreover, DTM provides a pricing method validation by simulating traffic systems, multi-agent interactions, and the heterogeneity and irrational behaviors of individuals in the trading market. Within the DTM platform, entities such as connected vehicles and traffic light controllers could engage in information collecting, data pricing, trading, and decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed AI agent-based pricing approach enhances data trading by offering rational prices, as evidenced by the observed improvement in traffic efficiency. This underscores the effectiveness and practical value of DTM, offering new perspectives for the evolution of data markets and smart cities.

        "abstract":"Satellite imaging is essential for urban planning and crisis management as it records detailed spatial information such as buildings, roads, and different types of land cover. Satellite image segmentation is necessary to analyze pictures and extract particular information for applications including urban planning, vegetation monitoring, and time series data analysis due to their complexity. Most segmentation models need input images of size (512,512), which may lead to pixelation or quality reduction due to cropping or zooming. High resolution input data might provide challenges in multiclass segmentation due to its extensive coverage area. This paper present a remodeled Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) to enhance picture quality and maintain crucial data for precise segmentation tasks. The segmentation process involves utilizing a U-Net architecture integrated with a ResNet50 encoder. This decision was taken to utilise ResNet50's advanced feature extraction skills while preserving U-Net's efficacy in obtaining contextual information for accurate segmentation. The network incorporates the Tversky loss function to effectively adjust the influence of various classes in the input data throughout the training process. The model demonstrates an accuracy of 0.94 and a mean Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.83 in multiclass segmentation tasks, properly outlining different land cover classes such as houses, woodlands, water bodies, and roads.",

Satellite image segmentation is necessary to analyze pictures and extract particular information for applications including urban planning, vegetation monitoring, and time series data analysis due to their complexity. Most segmentation models need input images of size (512,512), which may lead to pixelation or quality reduction due to cropping or zooming. High resolution input data might provide challenges in multiclass segmentation due to its extensive coverage area.",
        "contribution":"This paper present a remodeled Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) to enhance picture quality and maintain crucial data for precise segmentation tasks. The segmentation process involves utilizing a U-Net architecture integrated with a ResNet50 encoder. This decision was taken to utilise ResNet50's advanced feature extraction skills while preserving U-Net's efficacy in obtaining contextual information for accurate segmentation. The network incorporates the Tversky loss function to effectively adjust the influence of various classes in the input data throughout the training process. The model demonstrates an accuracy of 0.94 and a mean Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.83 in multiclass segmentation tasks, properly outlining different land cover classes such as houses, woodlands, water bodies, and roads.",

        "abstract":"The 3D virtual terrain generation is currently used in geography teaching and setting up relevant virtual scenes according to the teaching content, which can visually display the verification experimental conditions and results and enhance the universality of virtual geography experiments. In the field of digital twin smart city, traffic, and water simulation, constructing virtual terrain according to the real terrain can provide the basic environment for subsequent development and experiments. In military simulation, it can quickly build beyond the real scenes of extreme training environment, which has a key role in improving military training and enhancing combat capabilities. Hand-drawn feature sketches can express 3D virtual terrain under human subjective perception. Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details. This model is applied to the real natural landscape display and terrain evolution, and it can meet the user\u2019s needs to obtain the virtual terrain with high realistic feeling after inputting the hand-drawn terrain feature sketch.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated proficiency in various computer vision tasks, positioning them as promising tools for automated VQoSS assessment. In this paper, we pioneer the application of MLLMs to VQoSS change estimation, with our empirical findings affirming their effectiveness.

        "abstract":"Introduction: Optical and SAR image matching is one of the fields within multi-sensor imaging and fusion. It is crucial for various applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and urban planning, as it enables comprehensive and accurate analysis by combining the visual information of optical images with the penetrating capability of SAR images. However, the differences in imaging mechanisms between optical and SAR images result in significant nonlinear radiation distortion. Especially for SAR images, which are affected by speckle noises, resulting in low resolution and blurry edge structures, making optical and SAR image matching difficult and challenging. The key to successful matching lies in reducing modal differences and extracting similarity information from the images. Method: In light of this, we propose a structure similarity virtual map generation network (SVGNet) to address the task of optical and SAR image matching. The core innovation of this paper is that we take inspiration from the concept of image generation, to handle the predicament of image matching between different modalities. Firstly, we introduce the Attention U-Net as a generator to decouple and characterize optical images. And then, SAR images are consistently converted into optical images with similar textures and structures. At the same time, using the structural similarity (SSIM) to constrain structural spatial information to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, a conditional generative adversarial network is employed to further guide the image generation process. By combining synthesized SAR images and their corresponding optical images in a dual channel, we can enhance prior information. This combined data is then fed into the discriminator to determine whether the images are true or false, guiding the generator to optimize feature learning. Finally, we employ least squares loss (LSGAN) to stabilize the training of the generative adversarial network. Results and Discussion: Experiments have demonstrated that the SVGNet proposed in this paper is capable of effectively reducing modal differences, and it increases the matching success rate. Compared to direct image matching, using image generation ideas results in a matching accuracy improvement of more than twice.",

To address the intricate nature of transportation issues, many researchers and planners have analyzed the complexities of urban and regional road systems using transportation models by employing transportation indices such as road length, network density, accessibility, and connectivity metrics. This study addresses the complexities of predicting road network density for small and medium-sized Indian cities that come under the Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) project at a national level. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and the CityGAN model is introduced to predict network density using spatial indicators of human settlements. The major goal of this study is to generate hyper-realistic urban patterns of small and medium-sized Indian cities using an unsupervised CityGAN model and to study the causal relationship between human settlement indices (HSIs) and transportation index (network density) using supervised KRR for the real cities. The synthetic urban universes mimic Indian urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through the settlement indices can aid in comprehending urban landscape, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. We analyzed 503 real cities to find the actual relationship between the urban settlements and their road density. The nonlinear KRR model may help urban planners in deriving the network density for GAN-generated futuristic urban patterns through the settlement indicators. The proposed hybrid process, termed as RidgeGAN model, can gauge the sustainability of urban sprawl tied to infrastructure and transportation systems in sprawling cities.

The preparation of a massive labelled dataset is a cumbersome task and requires lot of human interventions. This paper proposes a novel generator network \u2018Sim2Real\u2019 transfer is a recent and fast-developing field in machine learning used to bridge the gap between simulated and real data. Training with simulated datasets often converges due to its size but fails to generalize real-world applications. Simulated datasets can be used to train and test deep learning models, enables the development and evaluation of new algorithms and architectures. By simulating road dataset, researchers can generate large amounts of realistic road-traffic dataset that can be used to study and understand several problems such as vehicular object tracking and classification, traffic situation analysis etc. The main advantage of such a transfer algorithm is to use the abundance of a simulated dataset to generate huge realistic-looking datasets to solve data-intense tasks. This work presents a novel, robust sim2real algorithm that converts the labels of a semantic segmentation map to a realistic-looking street view using the Cityscapes dataset and aims to achieve robust urban mobility for smart cities.

        "contribution":"This paper proposes a novel generator network \u2018Sim2Real\u2019 transfer is a recent and fast-developing field in machine learning used to bridge the gap between simulated and real data. Training with simulated datasets often converges due to its size but fails to generalize real-world applications. Simulated datasets can be used to train and test deep learning models, enables the development and evaluation of new algorithms and architectures. By simulating road dataset, researchers can generate large amounts of realistic road-traffic dataset that can be used to study and understand several problems such as vehicular object tracking and classification, traffic situation analysis etc. The main advantage of such a transfer algorithm is to use the abundance of a simulated dataset to generate huge realistic-looking datasets to solve data-intense tasks. This work presents a novel, robust sim2real algorithm that converts the labels of a semantic segmentation map to a realistic-looking street view using the Cityscapes dataset and aims to achieve robust urban mobility for smart cities.

However, various factors in complex scenes (e.g., high vegetation coverage occlusions) may lead to fragmentation in the extracted road networks and also affect the robustness of road extraction methods. This study proposes a multi-scale road extraction method with asymmetric generative adversarial learning (MS-AGAN). First, we design an asymmetric GAN with a multi-scale feature encoder to better utilize the context information in high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs). Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and feature fusion are integrated into the asymmetric encoder\u2013decoder structure to avoid feature redundancy caused by multi-level cascading operations and enhance the generator network\u2019s ability to extract fine-grained road information at the pixel level. Second, to maintain road connectivity, topologic features are considered in the pixel segmentation process. A linear structural similarity loss ((Formula presented.)) is introduced into the loss function of MS-AGAN, which guides MS-AGAN to generate more accurate segmentation results. Finally, to fairly evaluate the performance of deep models under complex backgrounds, the Bayesian error rate (BER) is introduced into the field of road extraction for the first time. Experiments are conducted via Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-resolution remote sensing images with high vegetation coverage in the Daxing District of Beijing, China, and the public DeepGlobe dataset. The performance of MS-AGAN is compared with a list of advanced models, including RCFSNet, CoANet, UNet, DeepLabV3+, and DiResNet. The final results show that (1) with respect to road extraction performance, the Recall, F1, and IoU values of MS-AGAN on the Daxing dataset are 2.17%, 0.04%, and 2.63% higher than the baselines. On DeepGlobe, the Recall, F1, and IoU of MS-AGAN improve by 1.12%, 0.42%, and 0.25%, respectively. (2) On road connectivity, the Conn index of MS-AGAN from the Daxing dataset is 46.39%, with an improvement of 0.62% over the baselines, and the Conn index of MS-AGAN on DeepGlobe is 70.08%, holding an improvement of 1.73% over CoANet. The quantitative and qualitative analyses both demonstrate the superiority of MS-AGAN in preserving road connectivity. (3) In particular, the BER of MS-AGAN is 20.86% over the Daxing dataset with a 0.22% decrease compared to the best baselines and 11.77% on DeepGlobe with a 0.85% decrease compared to the best baselines.

(2) On road connectivity, the Conn index of MS-AGAN from the Daxing dataset is 46.39%, with an improvement of 0.62% over the baselines, and the Conn index of MS-AGAN on DeepGlobe is 70.08%, holding an improvement of 1.73% over CoANet. The quantitative and qualitative analyses both demonstrate the superiority of MS-AGAN in preserving road connectivity. (3) In particular, the BER of MS-AGAN is 20.86% over the Daxing dataset with a 0.22% decrease compared to the best baselines and 11.77% on DeepGlobe with a 0.85% decrease compared to the best baselines. The proposed MS-AGAN provides an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable method for the dynamic updating of road networks via HRSIs.",

Deep generative learning gives us hope that we can automate this planning process and come up with the ideal urban plans. While remarkable achievements have been obtained, they have exhibited limitations in lacking awareness of: 1) the hierarchical dependencies between functional zones and spatial grids; 2) the peer dependencies among functional zones; and 3) human regulations to ensure the usability of generated configurations. To address these limitations, we develop a novel human-instructed deep hierarchical generative model. We rethink the urban planning generative task from a unique functionality perspective, where we summarize planning requirements into different functionality projections for better urban plan generation. To this end, we develop a three-stage generation process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function. The third stage is to leverage multi-attentions to model the zone-zone peer dependencies of the functionality projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations.

However, obtaining pixel-aligned hazy and clear paired images in the real world can be challenging. Therefore, synthesized hazed images are often used for training deep networks. These images are typically generated based on parameters such as depth information and atmospheric scattering coefficient. However, this approach may cause the loss of important haze details, leading to color distortion or incomplete dehazed images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for synthesizing hazed images using a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN is trained with unpaired hazy and clear images to learn the features of the hazy images. Then, the real haze features are added to clear images using the trained CycleGAN, resulting in well-pixel-aligned synthesized hazy and clear paired images that can be used for dehaze training. The results demonstrate that the dataset synthesized using this method efficiently solves the problem associated with traditional synthesized datasets. Furthermore, the dehazed images are restored using a super-resolution algorithm, enabling the obtainment of high-resolution clear images.

The objective is to generate a configuration tensor given the surrounding contexts of a target region. In particular, we first construct spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data crawled from websites to learn graph representations. We then combine each target area and its surrounding context representations as a tuple, and categorize all tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas).

In this study, we present an innovative approach to remove clouds from remote sensing data by employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with an integrated attention mechanism. Our method is designed to effectively restore regions obscured by clouds while preserving the integrity of the remaining image. We introduce a specialized architecture called U-net based Attention GAN (UAGAN) to address cloud cover issues. In this architecture, the generator network utilizes attention mechanisms to identify and rectify cloud-affected areas. The attention mechanism dynamically emphasizes relevant spatial regions during cloud removal, enhancing the precision of the restoration process. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments using the RICE dataset and trained our UAGAN model. Our method's effectiveness was assessed using quantitative metrics, including the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Comparative analysis of three different models, namely vanilla GAN, U-net GAN, and UAGAN, demonstrates that UAGAN outperforms the others with impressive results, achieving a PSNR of 29.901 dB, RMSE of 7.891, and SSIM of 0.971.This research contributes to the advancement of cloud removal techniques in remote sensing, offering a promising solution for improving data quality and enhancing the accuracy of downstream applications.

One can get over obstacles like varied geographical resolutions, spectral bands, and temporal coverage by fusing images from multiple satellites, such as Landsat8 and Sentinel 2. For various applications that involve observationof the Earth like land cover classification, monitoring of vegetation,disaster monitoring, and urban planning, the fusion process aims to produce composite images that integrate the spectral richness, spatial detail, and temporal frequency of the input images. The creation of Sentinel-like imagery from Landsat8 data enhances its potential for Earth observation applications, making the problem of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 imagery fusion very important to solve. A deep learning methodology is required to solve this problem because of its capacity to discover complex correlations and patterns within the data. In this paper, a U-Net Vision Transformer Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (UVCGAN) - based image fusion method that effectively transforms Landsat 8 images into Sentinel-like imagery is pro- posed.

Considerable deviations in fa\u00e7ade availability for BIPV deployments among the various tools as compared to our segmentation approach indicate the potential impact of the proposed method on policy-making and the benefits for BIPV design and planning.",

        "abstract":"When designing a new landscape, such as when demolishing buildings and building new ones, visual methods are effective in sharing a common image. It is possible to visualize future landscapes by making sketches and models, but this requires a great deal of skill and effort on the part of the creator. One method for visualizing future landscapes without the need for specialized skills or labor is image generation using deep learning, and a method has been proposed of using deep learning to generate landscape images after demolishing current buildings. However, there are two problems: the inability to remove arbitrary buildings and the inability to generate a landscape after reconstruction. Therefore, this study proposes a future landscape visualization method that integrates instance segmentation and a diffusion model. The proposed method can generate both post-removal images of existing buildings and post-reconstruction images based on text input, without the need for specialized technology or labor. Verification results confirmed that the post-removal image was more than 90% accurate when the building was removed and replaced with the sky. And the post-reconstruction image matched the text content with a best accuracy of more than 90%. This research will contribute to the realization of urban planning in which all project stakeholders, both professionals and the public, can directly participate by visualizing their own design proposals for future landscapes.",

        "introduction":"When designing a new landscape, such as when demolishing buildings and building new ones, visual methods are effective in sharing a common image. It is possible to visualize future landscapes by making sketches and models, but this requires a great deal of skill and effort on the part of the creator. One method for visualizing future landscapes without the need for specialized skills or labor is image generation using deep learning, and a method has been proposed of using deep learning to generate landscape images after demolishing current buildings. However, there are two problems: the inability to remove arbitrary buildings and the inability to generate a landscape after reconstruction.",

        "abstract":"Background. As an important part of smart cities, smart water environmental protection has become an important way to solve water environmental pollution problems. It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

        "contribution":"It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities",

Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities. This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different fa\u00e7ade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments. HIGHLIGHTS Machine learning use in outdoor thermal comfort assessment has been investigated. Vegetation, urban geometry, surface albedo, and water bodies have been studied parameters. Vegetation and street orientation have the highest and water bodies have the least impact on outdoor thermal comfort.

HIGHLIGHTS Machine learning use in outdoor thermal comfort assessment has been investigated. Vegetation, urban geometry, surface albedo, and water bodies have been studied parameters. Vegetation and street orientation have the highest and water bodies have the least impact on outdoor thermal comfort. Pix2pix algorithm implementation could create thermal comfort maps with 96% SSIM.",

We use these size-specific statistical findings to produce generative models for the expected amenity abundances of any US city. We then compute the deviations observed in given cities from this statistical many-amenity model to build a characteristic signature for each urban area.

However, even the most well-funded surveying agencies rely on sampling methods to estimate the nature of the true population, and the collected microdata is frequently aggregated, or limited in volume and detail to protect the privacy of respondents. Population synthesis provides a means to scale this microdata to represent larger regions for use in microsimulation. Despite their accuracy and widespread adoption, traditional synthesis algorithms for reweighting microdata samples scale poorly with the number of variables and geographic regions being modeled, and can suffer from non-convergence with smaller sample sizes. Several generative models have been proposed to address these shortcomings, but lack features such as sub-region modeling, and the ability to simultaneously generate both individuals and households. This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE\/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE\/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4\u201316 variables). The VAE\/CVAE also performs well with few (n = 100) training samples, with diminishing returns for additional training samples.",

Extensive experiments with multiple datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed FEDGAN-IDS. The model performs better and converges earlier than the state-of-the-art standalone IDS.",

        "abstract":"Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent city construction and public crisis management. Distinct from the single trajectory prediction which rely on strong temporal correlation, in the complex scenes, the trajectory reflects not only the temporal characteristics of a single person, but the interactive features between human and other moving objects nearby. Therefore, how to deeply describe such temporality and interactivity, and then to generate accurate trajectory prediction results according to the change of the scene has become a major problem in the field of trajectory prediction today. In recent years, deep learning has attracted great attention and achieved success in the trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of these methods capture the influence between pedestrians from a single view, and they fail to consider the multiple factors which have an effect on the decision of pedestrians, such as going straight or turning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-head attention generative adversarial model (MAGAM) which combines the multi-head attention mechanism and the generative adversarial network to model the pedestrian trajectory in the complex scenes. Specifically, the MAGAM model employs multi-head attention mechanism with relative displacement information to learn the attentive weight of subspace features in the whole trajectory feature space on different aspects, to realize the characterization of the interactive trajectory features that resulting from mutual influence between pedestrians. Moreover, the adversarial generation strategy and multi-trajectory generation strategy are used to achieve the reasonable generation of individual moving trajectory in the complex scenes. During the training process, the generator firstly extracts the personalized temporal features of pedestrians from historical observation sequences with long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoders. Secondly, the locations of pedestrians and temporal features are integrated into the multi-head attention model to learn the different weights and output the interactive state of the pedestrians. Thirdly, the interactive states and the Gaussian noise are fed into the LSTM-based decoders to generate multiple prediction trajectories. Then the discriminators are employed to judge whether the input trajectory belongs to the truth trajectory or generated trajectory as much as possible. By training with the adversarial mechanism, we could obtain the approximate truth results when modeling convergences. Finally, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct the experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY) which are widely used in the trajectory prediction tasks. We evaluate the prediction results based on three evaluation indicators: the average displacement error, the final displacement error, and the average no-linear displacement error. Compared with the existing trajectory prediction methods, the three metrics of the MAGAM model on all the datasets reduced by 26.90%, 21.02% and 24.06% on average. And the prediction results and the interactive scenes among pedestrians are visualized and analyzed which demonstrates the rationality of the results. Additionally, the performance of the MAGAM model including the average convergence accuracy, the average convergence time and the average prediction time is verified through related experiments, compared with the baselines, the MAGAM model gets the longest convergence time and prediction time.",

For these tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the dominant solution for the past decade, for their remarkable ability in learning discriminative features from images to boost retrieval performance. However, it is been discovered that DNNs are broadly vulnerable to maliciously constructed adversarial examples. By adding small perturbations to a query image, the returned retrieval results will be completely dissimilar from the query image. This poses serious challenges to vital systems in Smart City applications that depend on the DNN-based visual retrieval technology, as in the physical world, simple camouflage can be added on the subject (a few patches on the body or car), and turn the subject completely untrackable by person or vehicle Re-ID systems. To demonstrate the potential of such threats, this paper proposes a novel adversarial patch generative adversarial network (AP-GAN) to generate adversarial patches instead of modifying the entire image, which also causes the DNNs-based image retrieval models to return incorrect results. AP-GAN is trained in an unsupervised way that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once trained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries. Extensive experiments show that the AP-GAN achieves excellent attacking performance with various application scenarios that are based on deep features, including image retrieval, person ReID and vehicle ReID. The results of this study provide a warning that when deploying a DNNs-based image retrieval system, its security and robustness needs to be thoroughly considered.",

These extend to various areas in sustainability, including for satellite image analysis to obtain information such as land usage and extent of development. An interesting direction for which data-driven methods have not been applied much yet is in the quick quantitative evaluation of urban layouts for planning and design. In particular, urban designs typically involve complex trade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up and\/or consideration of urban heat island effect. Hence, it can be beneficial to urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban characteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity, without having to run compu-tationally expensive and time-consuming high-fidelity numerical simulations each time. This fast surrogate can then be potentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including generative models or other gradient-based methods. Here we present an investigation into the use of convolutional neural networks as a surrogate for urban layout characterization that is typically done via high-fidelity numerical simulation. We then further apply this model towards a first demonstration of its utility for data-driven pedestrian-level wind velocity prediction. The data set in this work comprises results from high-fidelity numerical simulations of wind velocities for a diverse set of realistic urban layouts, based on randomized samples from a real-world, highly built-up urban city. We then provide prediction results obtained from the neural network trained on this data-set, demonstrating test errors of under 0.1 m\/s for previously unseen novel urban layouts. We further illustrate how this can be useful for purposes such as rapid evaluation of pedestrian wind velocity for a potential new layout. In addition, it is hoped that this data set will further inspire, facilitate and accelerate research in data-driven urban AI, even as our baseline model facilitates quantitative comparison to future, more innovative methods.",

Once traffic estimation is performed in a 'new' city where many urban services and transportation infrastructures are not built and thus no prior data is available, those works would fail due to the lack of data. In this paper, we aim to solve the conditional urban traffic estimation problem in case of data scarcity (i.e., the target city cannot provide any prior data) and tackle the main challenges including (1) knowledge learning from the source and (2) knowledge adaptation without prior traffic data. We propose a novel generative adversarial network - Meta Spatial-Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (Mest-GAN), which can successfully estimate traffic in the target city based on local travel demands without the access to any prior traffic data. To address the first challenge, we learn the latent distribution of travel demands with the inference network, the latent distribution also indicates the diverse spatial-temporal traffic patterns. To solve the second challenge, we use the travel demand data in the target city for adaptation, where the inference network infers a latent code guiding the generator to produce accurate traffic estimations.

Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in video prediction and image generation, in this paper we propose a Seq2Seq Spatial-Temporal Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks named STS-GAN for multi-step urban flow prediction.

Furthermore, by integrating GAN\u2019s adversarial loss with prediction error, our STS-GAN can effectively address the blurry prediction issue.

        "abstract":"Urban traffic data plays an important role in urban transportation planning. Due to the scarcity of real-life urban traffic data, many transportation planning applications need to generate synthesized traffic flows based on the real-life trajectory datasets. However, those synthesized traffic flows can only fit the input trajectories, which are static and does not reflect the real traffic distributions. In this paper, we use a stochastic origin-destination (OD) matrix to represent the density of the dynamic traffic flows and then develop a dynamic traffic flow generator. We extract the stochastic OD matrix from the trajectory data, design an efficient neural network to the predict successive stochastic OD matrices, and deploy our model on a real-world road network. The proposed model surpasses the existing generative model in RMSE, MAE, VAR, KL indicators, and is significantly better than the existing model in the MAE indicator. Our traffic generator is able to dynamically adjust urban traffics to generate different simulation environments.",

In this work, we present the first generative model of city blocks named BlockPlanner, and showcase its ability to synthesize valid city blocks with varying land lots configurations. We propose a novel vectorized city block representation utilizing a ring topology and a two-tier graph to capture the global and local structures of a city block. Each land lot is abstracted into a vector representation covering both its 3D geometry and land use semantics. Such vectorized representation enables us to deploy a lightweight network to capture the underlying distribution of land lots configurations in a city block. To enforce intrinsic spatial constraints of a valid city block, a set of effective loss functions are imposed to shape rational results. We contribute a pilot city block dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our representation and framework over the state-of-the-art. Notably, our BlockPlanner is also able to edit and manipulate city blocks, enabling several useful applications, e.g., topology refinement and footprint generation.",

The problem is important in reducing traffic congestion, improving public transportation efficiency, and facilitating urban planning. However, solving this problem is challenging due to the strong spatial dependencies of traffic patterns and the complex relations between the traffic and urban conditions. In this paper, we tackle the challenges by proposing a novel Complex-Condition-Controlled Urban Traffic Estimation through Generative Adversarial Networks (C3-GAN) for urban traffic estimation of a region under various complex conditions. C3-GAN features the following three novel designs on top of standard cGAN model: (1) an embedding network mapping the complex conditions to a latent space to find representations of the urban conditions; (2) an inference network to enhance the relations between the embedded latent vectors and the traffic data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our C3-GAN produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Inspired by image generation, deep urban planning aims to leverage deep learning to generate land-use configurations. However, urban planning is a complex process. Existing studies usually ignore the need of personalized human guidance in planning, and spatial hierarchical structure in planning generation. Moreover, the lack of large-scale land-use configuration samples poses a data sparsity challenge. This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present extensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method.",

Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks. The experiments are performed and evaluated through 2 criteria: Detection rate (DR) and F1 Score (F1) on the public dataset, named CICIDS2017.

Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain.

Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.",

The recent advance of deep learning motivates us to ask: can machines learn at a human capability to automatically and quickly calculate land-use configuration, so human planners can finally adjust machine-generated plans for specific needs? To this end, we formulate the automated urban planning problem into a task of learning to configure land-uses, given the surrounding spatial contexts. To set up the task, we define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor, where each channel is a category of POIs and the value of an entry is the number of POIs. The objective is then to propose an adversarial learning framework that can automatically generate such tensor for an unplanned area. In particular, we first characterize the contexts of surrounding areas of an unplanned area by learning representations from spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data. Second, we combine each unplanned area and its surrounding context representation as a tuple, and categorize all the tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Third, we develop an adversarial land-use configuration approach, where the surrounding context representation is fed into a generator to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish among positive and negative samples. Finally, we devise two new measurements to evaluate the quality of land-use configurations and present extensive experiment and visualization results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

Having statistically representative spatial models can enable proxy models that improve our understanding of human patterns in urban and suburban areas.",
        "contribution":"Here, we analyse a data set of more than 400, 000 Tweets in London to create a spatial point process model of Tweet clusters. We model Tweet clusters as a Poisson Cluster Process. We then track how the point process parameter and spatial entropy evolve over time to create a generative model usable for others, as well as discuss its relevance to urban dynamics and smart city applications.",
