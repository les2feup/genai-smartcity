        "abstract":"The use of synthetic populations has grown considerably over the recent years, in revolutionizing studies conducted within various fields, including social science research, urban planning, public health and transportation modeling. These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and\/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners. This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals. In conclusion, despite a number of limitations, VAE constitutes a very promising methodology for generating synthetic populations, in offering practitioners numerous advantages.

        "introduction":"The use of synthetic populations has grown considerably over the recent years, in revolutionizing studies conducted within various fields, including social science research, urban planning, public health and transportation modeling. These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and\/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners.",
        "contribution":"This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals. In conclusion, despite a number of limitations, VAE constitutes a very promising methodology for generating synthetic populations, in offering practitioners numerous advantages. This paper is accompanied by a Python notebook to assist interested readers implement this new methodology.",

        "abstract":"Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) presents unique challenges and plays a critical role in applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce richly descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. However, most current RSIC models generally apply only fine-tuning to these datasets without developing models tailored to the unique characteristics of remote sensing imagery. This paper proposes RS-MoE, the first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) task.",

Radio maps play a crucial role in understanding the spatial radio environment, which is essential for wireless applications such as cell planning and radio resource management. However, generating radio maps is a resource-intensive task, as the construction process is complex and the distribution process consumes substantial bandwidth. This article proposes a method that combines semantic communication (SemCom) and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to optimize the construction and distribution processes of radio maps. By incorporating SemCom, our method transmits only key semantic information during the distribution process, significantly reducing bandwidth usage while ensuring accurate and efficient information transfer. While the diverse generative capabilities of GAI introduce some instability, which could be a limitation in radio map construction, this article achieves precise content decoding through prompts based on multi-modal semantic information, enabling accurate construction and restoration of radio maps. By utilizing SemCom and GAI technologies, the cost of applications of radio maps can be significantly reduced, which is beneficial for stimulating the pace of intelligence evolution in future mobile networks.",

        "abstract":"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extensively used in event monitoring and tracking, particularly in scenarios that require minimal human intervention. However, a key challenge in WSNs is the short lifespan of sensor nodes (SN), as continuous sensing leads to rapid battery depletion. In high-traffic areas, sensors located near the sink node exhaust their energy quickly, creating an energy-hole issue. As a result, optimizing energy usage is a significant challenge for WSN-assisted applications. To address this, this paper proposes an Energy-aware Routing and Cluster Head Selection in Wireless Sensor Network through an Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network for Golden Search Optimization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Network (EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA). This method involves selecting the Cluster Head (CH) using Attentive Dual Residual Generative Adversarial Network (ADRGAN), minimizing energy consumption, and reducing a number of dead sensor nodes. Subsequently, Golden Search Optimization Algorithm (GSOA) is employed to determine an optimal path for data transmission to the sink node, maximizing energy efficiency, and elongating sensor node lifespan. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA method is simulated in MATLAB. The performance metrics, such as network lifetime, number of alive nodes, number of dead nodes, throughput, energy consumption, and packet delivery ratio is examined. The proposed EAR-WSN-ADRGAN-GSOA demonstrates improved performance, achieving a higher average throughput of 0.93 Mbps, and lower average energy consumption of 0.39 mJ compared with the existing methods. These improvements have significant real-world implications for enhancing the efficiency and longevity of WSNs in applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and industrial automation.",

In response to this demand, this paper puts forward a technique based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for converting aerial imagery into high-quality maps. The proposed method, comprising a generator and a discriminator, introduces novel strategies to overcome existing challenges; namely, the use of a Canny edge detector and Residual Blocks. The proposed loss function enhances the generator\u2019s performance by assigning greater weight to edge regions using the Canny edge map and eliminating superfluous information. This approach enhances the visual quality of the generated maps and ensures the accurate capture of fine details. The experimental results demonstrate that this method generates maps of superior visual quality, achieving outstanding performance compared to existing methodologies. The results show that the proposed technology has significant potential for practical applications in a range of real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract":"Image super-resolution technology enhances image clarity and enriches image detail by improving image spatial resolution, enabling quality enhancement without changing hardware conditions. Given the large size, complex target features, and abundant details of remote sensing images, along with the need for efficient information acquisition, we propose a Diffusion Super-Resolution (DSR) algorithm based on a conditional diffusion model. This approach uses low-resolution remote sensing images from the same region as conditioning inputs to the diffusion model, while high-resolution images with added noise are concatenated as inputs. A deep noise training network was constructed with U-Net as the backbone, incorporating residual connections and self-attention mechanisms. The loss function was also improved for better super-resolution results. The DSR method was tested using high-resolution remote sensing images from multiple periods of the domestic Gaofen and SuperView satellite series. The super-resolution results demonstrated pixel dimension expansion from 32 to 128. Comparative experiments with Bicubic, SRGAN, Real-ESRGAN, and SwinIR super-resolution algorithms showed that the DSR method outperforms these algorithms in both PSNR and SSIM metrics. Additionally, the DSR method significantly improves the quality of multispectral remote sensing images. By leveraging the conditional diffusion model, it successfully preserves rich detail and enhances spatial resolution without compromising image clarity. This method offers an efficient solution for super-resolution reconstruction, ensuring effective information acquisition in remote sensing applications and fulfilling the requirements of various domains such as land use classification, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. Moreover, the DSR method also opens new avenues for future research by demonstrating the potential of diffusion models in remote sensing image processing. It overcomes the limitations of simple convolutional networks, which extract only shallow features, and avoids the convergence issues commonly seen in adversarial neural networks during training, ultimately improving the restoration of rich details in remote sensing images.",

        "abstract":"Taipei City has been experimenting with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to enhance its smart capabilities, aiming to increase citizen satisfaction. This initiative is part of the city\u2019s Smart City Proof of Concept (PoC) projects, which have been progressively rolled out since 2015. Most of these projects incorporate AI tools or algorithms, such as the combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) with AI to form AIoT, or the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). The objective is to leverage the latest technological developments to achieve a smarter Taipei. This study analyzes the execution of 302 PoC projects, categorizing them into 22 technological segments that together form an AI framework for smart city construction applications. This framework corresponds to 15 major issues of concern to Taipei\u2019s residents, with the potential to address or mitigate 13 of them. According to the IMD Smart City Index Report 2023, Taipei\u2019s smart city rating improved from a B in 2021 to an A in 2023, indicating progress. The results demonstrate that the AI framework derived from dissecting multiple PoC projects can effectively enhance the city\u2019s smart construction ratings.

        "abstract":"City modeling and generation have attracted an increased interest in various applications, including gaming, urban planning, and autonomous driving. Unlike previous works focused on the generation of single objects or indoor scenes, the huge volumes of spatial data in cities pose a challenge to the generative models. Furthermore, few publicly available 3D real-world city datasets also hinder the development of methods for city generation. In this paper, we first collect over 3,000,000 geo-referenced objects for the cities of New York, Zurich, Tokyo, Berlin, Boston, and several other large cities. Based on this dataset, we propose AETree, a tree-structured auto-encoder neural network, for city generation. Specifically, we first propose a novel Spatial-Geometric Distance (SGD) metric to measure the similarity between building layouts and then construct a binary tree over the raw geometric data of the building based on the SGD metric. Next, we present a tree-structured network whose encoder learns to extract and merge spatial information from the bottom-up iteratively. The resulting global representation is reversely decoded for reconstruction or generation. To address the issue of long-dependency as the level of the tree increases, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Cell is employed as a basic network element of the proposed AETree. Moreover, we introduce a novel metric, Overlapping Area Ratio (OAR), to quantitatively evaluate the generation results. Experiments on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline models, such as LayoutTransformer and LayoutVAE, in terms of key metrics. Specifically, the proposed model achieves a Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence (JSD) of 0.0033, compared to 0.0041 and 0.0061 for LayoutTransformer and LayoutVAE, respectively. Similarly, for the Overall Accuracy Rate (OAR), the proposed model scores 1.66, significantly better than 28.24 and 19.01 for the baseline models Furthermore, the latent features learned by AETree can serve downstream urban planning applications.

Using a structured narrative review method with a critical approach, the study highlights AI\u2019s versatility in analyzing complex social phenomena, understanding human behavior, and optimizing urban infrastructure. With its unique socio-cultural challenges, Saudi Arabia aims for sustainable development through Saudi Vision 2030 and various smart city projects, emphasizing the importance of addressing challenges like gender equality, cultural preservation, an increasing youth population, rapid urbanization, and climate change. The study identifies ten AI applications and models to address these challenges and promote relevant SDGs across six areas: Predictive Analytics and Forecasting, Optimization and Decision Support, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Geospatial AI. These AI models can help address issues like gender equality, youth education, and employment, as well as optimize water management, energy use, and urban planning to address rapid urbanization and climate change challenges. By aligning AI development with the goals outlined in the SDGs, Saudi Arabia can unlock the potential of AI to create sustainable, resilient, and inclusive smart cities that effectively address socio-cultural challenges. However, the study emphasizes the necessity of customizing AI applications in smart cities based on Saudi Arabia\u2019s religious and cultural values to ensure ethical and culturally sensitive implementations. The findings of this study hold relevance not only for Saudi Arabia but also for other countries facing similar challenges. The study provides practical recommendations for policymakers, urban planners, and technology experts to leverage AI effectively for sustainable development. It also outlines future research directions to address the limitations identified, such as exploring implementation challenges and ethical considerations.",

This literature review paper provides in-depth analysis of the existing research on data poisoning attacks and examines how intelligent networks can mitigate these threats. Specifically, the author explores how malicious users inject fake training data into adversarial networks, a technique known as a data poisoning attack, which can severely compromise the model\u2019s integrity. Through a comparative evaluation of the attack strategies and defense mechanisms, such as robust optimization and model-based detection, the author assesses the strengths and limitations of current defenses. Real-world applications are discussed, including the use of these networks in cybersecurity, healthcare, and smart city systems. The author concludes by outlining the challenges and future directions in developing more effective defense strategies to detect and mitigate data poisoning attacks in real time, ensuring the security and privacy of intelligent networks.",

This literature review paper provides in-depth analysis of the existing research on data poisoning attacks and examines how intelligent networks can mitigate these threats. Specifically, the author explores how malicious users inject fake training data into adversarial networks, a technique known as a data poisoning attack, which can severely compromise the model\u2019s integrity. Through a comparative evaluation of the attack strategies and defense mechanisms, such as robust optimization and model-based detection, the author assesses the strengths and limitations of current defenses. Real-world applications are discussed, including the use of these networks in cybersecurity, healthcare, and smart city systems. The author concludes by outlining the challenges and future directions in developing more effective defense strategies to detect and mitigate data poisoning attacks in real time, ensuring the security and privacy of intelligent networks.",

This poses a major problem especially in the context of electricity load prediction where high quality data are essential. To address this issue, this paper presents a framework that transforms datasets with missing values into high quality and high-resolution datasets using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The capability of this framework was exhibited through a case study, the CIC-IPN electricity consumption dataset. Results show that the framework was able to successfully impute the missing values in the dataset while capturing the general patterns in the data. This framework can then be used to upscale other electricity datasets that contain missing values which can then be further used for electricity load prediction for smart cities and smart buildings.",

These technologies herald a significant transformation, propelling DTs beyond their current capabilities to become more dynamic, predictive, and interactive tools that can simulate complex scenarios and anticipate future conditions with remarkable accuracy. By systematically examining the levels of GAI integration within DTs, this study delves into the methodologies and strategies for embedding AI capabilities into these virtual models.

        "abstract":"The 3D virtual terrain generation is currently used in geography teaching and setting up relevant virtual scenes according to the teaching content, which can visually display the verification experimental conditions and results and enhance the universality of virtual geography experiments. In the field of digital twin smart city, traffic, and water simulation, constructing virtual terrain according to the real terrain can provide the basic environment for subsequent development and experiments. In military simulation, it can quickly build beyond the real scenes of extreme training environment, which has a key role in improving military training and enhancing combat capabilities. Hand-drawn feature sketches can express 3D virtual terrain under human subjective perception. Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details. This model is applied to the real natural landscape display and terrain evolution, and it can meet the user\u2019s needs to obtain the virtual terrain with high realistic feeling after inputting the hand-drawn terrain feature sketch. This improved model proposed in this paper has good prospects for 3D terrain modeling and editing.",

While the extraction of LULC information from multispectral satellite images has been a well-studied part of past and present research, only a few studies emerged about the recovery of spectral properties from LULC information. Estimates of the spectral characteristics of LULC categories could enrich LULC forecasting models by providing necessary information to delineate vegetation indices or microclimatic parameters. We train two identical Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) to synthesize a multispectral Sentinel-2 image based on different combinations of open-source LULC data sets. Large-scale synthetic multispectral satellite images of the administrative region of Bonn and Rhein-Sieg in Germany are generated with a Euclidean distance-based patch-fusion method. The approach generated a realistic-looking satellite image without noticeable seams between patch borders. Based on several metrics, such as difference calculations, the spectral information divergence (SID), and the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID), we evaluate the resulting images. The models reach mean SIDs as low as 0.026 for urban fabrics and forests and FIDs below 90 for bands B2 and B5 showing that the CGAN is capable of synthesizing distinct synthetic features matching with features typical for respective LULC categories and manages to mimic multispectral signatures. The method used in this paper to generate large-scale synthetic multispectral satellite images can be used as an approach to support scenario-oriented sustainable urban planning.",

        "abstract":"Introduction: Optical and SAR image matching is one of the fields within multi-sensor imaging and fusion. It is crucial for various applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and urban planning, as it enables comprehensive and accurate analysis by combining the visual information of optical images with the penetrating capability of SAR images. However, the differences in imaging mechanisms between optical and SAR images result in significant nonlinear radiation distortion. Especially for SAR images, which are affected by speckle noises, resulting in low resolution and blurry edge structures, making optical and SAR image matching difficult and challenging. The key to successful matching lies in reducing modal differences and extracting similarity information from the images. Method: In light of this, we propose a structure similarity virtual map generation network (SVGNet) to address the task of optical and SAR image matching. The core innovation of this paper is that we take inspiration from the concept of image generation, to handle the predicament of image matching between different modalities. Firstly, we introduce the Attention U-Net as a generator to decouple and characterize optical images. And then, SAR images are consistently converted into optical images with similar textures and structures. At the same time, using the structural similarity (SSIM) to constrain structural spatial information to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, a conditional generative adversarial network is employed to further guide the image generation process. By combining synthesized SAR images and their corresponding optical images in a dual channel, we can enhance prior information. This combined data is then fed into the discriminator to determine whether the images are true or false, guiding the generator to optimize feature learning. Finally, we employ least squares loss (LSGAN) to stabilize the training of the generative adversarial network. Results and Discussion: Experiments have demonstrated that the SVGNet proposed in this paper is capable of effectively reducing modal differences, and it increases the matching success rate. Compared to direct image matching, using image generation ideas results in a matching accuracy improvement of more than twice.",

However, due to challenges such as water-area matching difficulties and issues like data redundancy and insufficient observations, existing full-automatic 3D modeling methods often result in water-area missing and many small holes in the models and insufficient local-model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, full-automatic high-precision scene 3D reconstruction method with water-area intelligent complementation on depth maps and mesh optimization is proposed. Firstly, SfM was used to calculated image poses and PatchMatch was used to generated initial depth maps. Secondly, a simplified GAN extracted water-area masks and ray tracing was used achieve high-precision auto-completed water-area depth values. Thirdly, fully connected CRF optimized water-areas and arounds in depth maps. Fourthly, high-precision 3D point clouds were obtained using depth map fusion based on clustering culling and depth least squares. Then, mesh was generated and optimized using similarity measurement and vertex gradients to obtain refined mesh. Finally, high-precision scene 3D models without water-area missing or holes were generated. The results showed that: to compare with the-state-of-art ContextCapture, the proposed method enhances model completeness by 14.3%, raises average accuracy by 14.5% and improves processing efficiency by 63.6%.",

        "abstract":"Semantic image synthesis, a pivotal task in image-to-image translation, has been widely addressed using generative adversarial network (GAN) models. However, existing GAN-based approaches often suffer from inadequate incorporation of structural and spatial information, resulting in unsatisfactory quality of the synthesized images and a pronounced disparity between photo-realistic and generated images. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based methodology to address these limitations, enabling the generation of high-resolution images from semantic label maps while bridging the quality gap and preserving detailed information in the generated outputs. The proposed approach leverages a two-step process, starting with a local binary pattern convolutional generator that produces a local binary pattern feature map. Subsequently, a global convolutional generator is fed with the segmentation map and the feature map through a learned modulation scheme facilitated by a multi-feature adaptive denormalization layer (MFADE) during the training process to generate photo-realistic images. Extensive experiments using Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO-stuff datasets validate the performance of our proposed method and showcase its accuracy and robustness in addressing semantic image synthesis tasks, thereby paving the way for its potential applications in enhancing urban sensing and data analytics in Smart Cities.

Urban flow, a typical kind of geospatial data, is critical for a wide range of applications from public safety and traffic management to urban planning. Existing studies mostly focus on predictive modeling of urban flow that predicts the future flow based on historical flow data, which may be unavailable in data-sparse areas or newly planned regions. Some other studies aim to predict OD flow among regions but they fail to model dynamic changes of urban flow over time. In this work, we study a new problem of urban flow generation that generates dynamic urban flow for regions without historical flow data. To capture the effect of multiple factors on urban flow, such as region features and urban environment, we employ diffusion model to generate urban flow for regions under different conditions. We first construct an urban knowledge graph (UKG) to model the urban environment and relationships between regions, based on which we design a knowledge-enhanced spatio-temporal diffusion model (KSTDiff) to generate urban flow for each region. Specifically, to accurately generate urban flow for regions with different flow volumes, we design a novel diffusion process guided by a volume estimator, which is learnable and customized for each region. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-enhanced denoising network to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of urban flow as well as the impact of urban environment in the denoising process. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art baselines in urban flow generation. Further in-depth studies demonstrate the utility of generated urban flow data and the ability of our model for long-term flow generation and urban flow prediction.

However, neither of these approaches can effectively utilize the rich contextual information that exists in videos, which makes it difficult to accurately perceive anomalous activities. In this paper, we exploit the idea of a training model based on the \u201cCloze Test\u201d strategy in natural language processing (NLP) and introduce a novel unsupervised learning framework to encode both motion and appearance information at an object level. Specifically, to store the normal modes of video activity reconstructions, we first design an optical stream memory network with skip connections. Secondly, we build a space\u2013time cube (STC) for use as the basic processing unit of the model and erase a patch in the STC to form the frame to be reconstructed. This enables a so-called \u201dincomplete event (IE)\u201d to be completed. On this basis, a conditional autoencoder is utilized to capture the high correspondence between optical flow and STC. The model predicts erased patches in IEs based on the context of the front and back frames. Finally, we employ a generating adversarial network (GAN)-based training method to improve the performance of VAD. By distinguishing the predicted erased optical flow and erased video frame, the anomaly detection results are shown to be more reliable with our proposed method which can help reconstruct the original video in IE. Comparative experiments conducted on the benchmark UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets demonstrate AUROC scores reaching 97.7%, 89.7%, and 75.8%, respectively.",

Restoring these cities is set to become one of the main priorities of the Ukrainian government in the near future. Because of its importance and sensitivity, cutting-edge technology should be used at every step of the task. The restoration process should use best European experience and practices. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) style transfer can help with modelling how the city would look if restored using techniques from selected European cities. Moreover, it can model the properties of smart planning of city, for instance a green zones optimization. This paper presents a novel approach to urban restoration planning using GANs to capture and translate architectural and urban planning styles from European cities into the reconstruction of a Ukrainian city. The study focuses on the destroyed city of Mariupol and evaluates the impact of these stylistic influences on greenspace distribution in the restored urban environment. In our case study, we transferred architectural features of Polish and Italian urban project and determined that for this specific city, the Polish urban planning model would be more beneficiary. The total proportion of greenspaces in the area was shown to be 7.18% with Polish project, compared to 5.32% of the Italian model.",

In order to deliver accurate and high quality surveillance in the context of smart cities, image de-raining is a crucial subject that has been explored extensively in recent years. In order to handle the challenge of removing raindrops, two different strategies are adopted in this research study: The Diffusion model and the Generative adversarial network model. By considering the recent improvements in image deraining methods, this research study proposes a novel technique that makes use of conditional generative adversarial network with adversarial loss, which provides a factor to loss functions and regulates the output for achieving the improved results. In addition, diffusion modelling, a novel patch-based method is used to perform image restoration. Diffusion probabilistic frameworks are used for normalising noise over affected regions. This research study compares and evaluates how well these two techniques perform in eliminating the raindrops from images. This study demonstrates that the diffusion model outperforms the GAN technique in terms of qualitative assessments and visual appearance by conducting a comparative analysis on actual and synthetic data.",

To have a fast and accurate path loss prediction, this article applies a deep learning-based image-to-image translation technique to construct a path loss model in urban environments. The proposed method combines a variational autoencoder with a generative adversarial network to translate images from the domain of street maps to the domain of path loss. It is trained in a supervised manner using paired samples, where the input is the street map with 3-D building information and the output is the path loss in the area obtained from the ray-tracing model. Based on a realistic digital map of urban Taipei city, simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms conventional ones when operating at the 3.5 GHz frequency band. The standard deviation of prediction error is reduced by over 62%. Besides prediction accuracy, the proposed model has the advantage of low computational complexity over ray-tracing techniques. Hence, it has great potential for the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) for future communication systems. In this future work, the optimal UAV mobility can be determined upon the rapid evaluation of the UAV-BS coverage using the proposed model.",

For these tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the dominant solution for the past decade, for their remarkable ability in learning discriminative features from images to boost retrieval performance. However, it is been discovered that DNNs are broadly vulnerable to maliciously constructed adversarial examples. By adding small perturbations to a query image, the returned retrieval results will be completely dissimilar from the query image. This poses serious challenges to vital systems in Smart City applications that depend on the DNN-based visual retrieval technology, as in the physical world, simple camouflage can be added on the subject (a few patches on the body or car), and turn the subject completely untrackable by person or vehicle Re-ID systems. To demonstrate the potential of such threats, this paper proposes a novel adversarial patch generative adversarial network (AP-GAN) to generate adversarial patches instead of modifying the entire image, which also causes the DNNs-based image retrieval models to return incorrect results. AP-GAN is trained in an unsupervised way that requires only a small amount of unlabeled data for training. Once trained, it produces query-specific perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries. Extensive experiments show that the AP-GAN achieves excellent attacking performance with various application scenarios that are based on deep features, including image retrieval, person ReID and vehicle ReID. The results of this study provide a warning that when deploying a DNNs-based image retrieval system, its security and robustness needs to be thoroughly considered.",

Firstly, it proposes a handwritten word recognition model based on generalized search trees (GIST) and the pyramid histogram of oriented gradient (PHOG). The local features and global features of the font are fused. Secondly, a model of automatic artistic typeface generation based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) is constructed, which can use hand-drawn fonts to automatically generate artistic typefaces in the desired style through training as needed. Finally, the generation of the huaniao typeface is used as an example. By constructing the dataset, the effectiveness of the two models is verified. The experimental results show the following: (1) The proposed handwritten character recognition model based on GIST and PHOG has a higher recognition rate of different fonts than the single GIST and PHOG features by more than 5.8%. The total recognition time is reduced by more than 49.4%, and the performance is improved significantly. (2) Compared with other popular algorithms, the constructed GAN-based automatic artistic typeface generation model has the best quality of the generation of huaniao on both the pencil sketch and the calligraphy character image dataset. Models have broad application prospects in contemporary advertising text art design. This study aims to provide important technical support for the automation of contemporary advertising text art design and the improvement of overall efficiency.",

To alleviate this problem, time series augmentation aims to generate synthetic time series by learning useful features from collected time series. As the popular generative model, generative adversarial networks (GAN) is regarded as a promising model for time series augmentation. However, applying GAN to the time series data suffers from a challenge in which the generated instances hold low quality but the model has gotten saturation. In this paper, for time series augmentation, we proposed TSA-GAN which is a robust GAN model with a self-adaptive recovering strategy to solve this problem. On 85 datasets of the UCR 2015 archive, our proposed TSA-GAN helps time series classifiers achieve performance improvements ranging from 8.3% to 12.5%, which is far better than the baseline.",

The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities.

In this paper, we leveraged GANs and proposed a new architecture with a cascaded Single Shot Detector (SSD) for pedestrian detection at distance, which is yet a challenge due to the varied sizes of pedestrians in videos at distance. To overcome the low-resolution issues in pedestrian detection at distance, DCGAN is employed to improve the resolution first to reconstruct more discriminative features for a SSD to detect objects in images or videos. A crucial advantage of our method is that it learns a multi-scale metric to distinguish multiple objects at different distances under one image, while DCGAN serves as an encoder-decoder platform to generate parts of an image that contain better discriminative information. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) dataset, and it was demonstrated that the proposed new architecture achieved a much better detection rate, particularly on vehicles and pedestrians at distance, making it highly suitable for smart cities applications that need to discover key objects or pedestrians at distance.",

To overcome the low-resolution issues in pedestrian detection at distance, DCGAN is employed to improve the resolution first to reconstruct more discriminative features for a SSD to detect objects in images or videos. A crucial advantage of our method is that it learns a multi-scale metric to distinguish multiple objects at different distances under one image, while DCGAN serves as an encoder-decoder platform to generate parts of an image that contain better discriminative information. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed method, experiments were carried out on the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) dataset, and it was demonstrated that the proposed new architecture achieved a much better detection rate, particularly on vehicles and pedestrians at distance, making it highly suitable for smart cities applications that need to discover key objects or pedestrians at distance.",

The features learned from the corrupted real data by the discriminator are used by the generator to recover real data. Since the denoising loss can estimate the local properties of data generation density, adding denoising loss to the GAN objective functions can improve the quality and diversity of generated samples. Adding reconstruction loss of latent codes to the generator further improves the performance of GAN. Therefore, the optimizing signal of the generator comes from three aspects: the adversarial loss like in standard GAN, the denoising loss of real data and the reconstruction loss of latent codes, which help to prevent the no gradient problem. We evaluate the quality and diversity of generated samples with the robust metric Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, a measure that can detect the intra-class mode dropping and is consistent with human assessment. In addition, we conduct a battery of experiments with the widely used architecture DCGAN and the complex architecture ResNet to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",
