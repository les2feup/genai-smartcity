# On the Role of AI in Building Generative Urban Intelligence

This study explores the applications, impacts, challenges, and promising future trends of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within the context of smart cities, discussing generative urban intelligence perspectives for simulating alternative urban scenarios, co-designing infrastructure prototypes, and improving service delivery. It provides a pioneering perspective on an underexplored field that is expected to transform urban design, planning, and management.

We developed a reproducible framework grounded in peer-reviewed literature and systematic Natural Language Processing (NLP) analytical approach. The framework is designed to facilitate the identification of GenAI applications in smart cities, enabling to systematically explore the potential of generative models in urban contexts.
