Traditional methods often rely on designing crafted, domain-specific models, and typically focus on short-term predictions, which struggle to generalize across diverse urban environments. In this study, we introduce Llama-3-8B-Mob, a large language model fine-tuned with instruction tuning, for long-term citywide mobility prediction—in a Q&A manner. We validate our approach using large-scale human mobility data from four metropolitan areas in Japan, focusing on predicting individual trajectories over the next 15 days. The results demonstrate that Llama-3-8B-Mob excels in modeling long-term human mobility—surpassing the state-of-the-art on multiple prediction metrics. It also displays strong zero-shot generalization capabilities—effectively generalizing to other cities even when fine-tuned only on limited samples from a single city.

During the transition period in which AVs and HDVs coexist, adaptable infrastructure is essential to accommodate both vehicle types. Traditional research, typically reliant on complex mathematical models and simulations, faces challenges in adapting to diverse urban settings, requiring substantial time and resources. To address these challenges, a government-level framework was developed, enabling urban planners to quickly and accurately evaluate and optimize existing parking facilities for future AV and HDV coexistence scenarios. The framework integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance flexibility and efficiency in parking planning throughout the transitional period. Structured guidance is incorporated to enhance decision-making precision and reduce LLM hallucination risks. The flexibility, robustness, and accuracy of the framework were validated through step-by-step and end-to-end testing using real-world datasets. Specifically, the framework achieved 91.1 % comprehensiveness and 70.2 % consistency in Indicator Selection Module testing, a 68.9 % success rate in the Single Indicator Calculation Module, and a 66.7 % success rate in end-to-end testing, demonstrating its practical value in supporting cities during AV integration. Finally, the success rates of different LLM agent modules were further explored, along with a comparison of multiple LLMs and an analysis of key issues related to LLM trustworthiness in urban planning applications.

Unfortunately, customer support service through online chat is often not rated by customers to help improve the service. This study employs artificial intelligence and data augmentation to predict customer satisfaction ratings from conversations by analyzing the responses of customers and service providers. For the study, the authors obtained actual conversations between customers and real agents from the call center database of Jeddah Municipality that were rated by customers on a scale of 1–5. They trained and tested five prediction models with approaches based on logistic regression, random forest, and ensemble-based deep learning, and fine-tuned two pre-trained recent models: ArabicT5 and SaudiBERT. Then, they repeated training and testing models after applying a data augmentation technique using the generative artificial intelligence, GPT-4, to improve the unbalance in customer conversation data. The study found that the ensemble-based deep learning approach best predicts the five-, three-, and two-class classifications. Moreover, data augmentation improved accuracy using the ensemble-based deep learning model with a 1.69% increase and the logistic regression model with a 3.84% increase.

In our approach, LLMs leverage their capabilities in data interpretation, common-sense reasoning, and mathematical modeling to assist decision makers by reducing cognitive load. They achieve this by automating aspects of information processing and option evaluation, while preserving human oversight as a crucial component of the final decision-making process. Another significant strength of our framework lies in its potential to drive the evolution of a new generation of decision support systems (DSSs).

This study explores using open-vocabulary classification algorithms to segment and identify pavement types and surface materials in this scenario. Our approach uses large language models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy of classifying different pavement types. The methodology involves two experiments: the first uses free prompting with random street-view images, employing Grounding Dino and SAM algorithms to assess performance across categories. The second experiment evaluates standardized pavement classification using the Deep Pavements dataset and a fine-tuned CLIP algorithm optimized for detecting OSM-compliant pavement categories.

Therefore, prediction of air quality is significant for improving the health of living beings as highly polluted regions have a higher concentration of pollutants mixed in the air, affecting the respiratory system and reducing the lifetime. To control pollution, AQI is used as a measure for estimating the pollutant content in the air. Even though many existing techniques have predicted AQI, enhancement is required in prediction algorithms with minimized loss. To address the challenges in traditional algorithms, the proposed smart cities-based AQI prediction intends to utilize the proposed regression algorithm in the dataset, namely Air- Quality-Data, which collected harmful pollutants on an hourly and daily basis from multiple cities in India between 2015 to 2020. To achieve prediction efficiency with reduced loss, pre-processing of input data is being performed using Deep GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). It performs the imputation of data in place of missing values to improve accurate prediction. Additionally, feature scaling normalizes independent real-data features to a fixed scale. With the processed data, regression is done through modified Stacked Attention GRU with KL divergence, which predicts Ernakulam, Chennai and Ahmedabad cities with higher, medium, and low levels of AQI in India.

Such capability alongside known urban landmarks holds promise for constructing contextual reference databases and improving image-based localization in ever-changing urban environments. Central to our methodology is the creation of a contextual tiled image-map, offering a novel perspective on urban mapping. We systematically organize a specific urban area into a structured sequence of satellite-simulated image tiles derived from ground-level data using the street2sat generative model. Each tile is indexed by its direction of travel, geographically tagged, and annotated with visible landmarks identified through a custom landmark segmentation model, creating a comprehensive contextual database. The localization process initiates with the submission of street-level image to a landmark segmentation model, which identifies recognizable landmarks within the image. These landmarks refine the subsequent search process by pinpointing tile locations in the image-map associated with similar landmarks, narrowing down the search scope to a set of valid indexes. Following the initial step, the image query is processed by our street2sat generative model, which transforms the street-level image into a corresponding satellite view. This view is then matched against a collection of pre-validated tiles to find the closest match.

This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

In this tutorial, we begin by offering a comprehensive review and analysis of existing methods that integrate LLMs with graphs. We introduce existing works based on a novel taxonomy that classifies them into three distinct categories according to the roles of LLMs in graph tasks: as enhancers, predictors, or alignment components.

Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learn and optimize human urban strategies (or policies) from pre-collected human-generated spatial-temporal urban data. However, standard offline RL faces two significant challenges: (1) data scarcity and data heterogeneity, and (2) distributional shift. In this paper, we introduce MODA - a Multi-Task Offline Reinforcement Learning with Contrastive Data Sharing approach. MODA addresses the challenges of data scarcity and heterogeneity in a multi-task urban setting through Contrastive Data Sharing among tasks. This technique involves extracting latent representations of human behaviors by contrasting positive and negative data pairs. It then shares data presenting similar representations with the target task, facilitating data augmentation for each task. Moreover, MODA develops a novel model-based multi-task offline RL algorithm. This algorithm constructs a robust Markov Decision Process (MDP) by integrating a dynamics model with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Once the robust MDP is established, any online RL or planning algorithm can be applied. Extensive experiments conducted in a real-world multi-task urban setting validate the effectiveness of MODA.

Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes. The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens' trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources.

Nighttime safety in metropolitan areas has long been a global concern, particularly for large cities with diverse demographics and intricate urban forms, whose citizens are often threatened by higher street-level crime rates. However, due to the lack of night-time urban appearance data, prior studies based on street view imagery (SVI) rarely addressed the perceived night-time safety issue, which can generate important implications for crime prevention. This study hypothesizes that night-time SVI can be effectively generated from widely existing daytime SVIs using generative AI (GenAI). To test the hypothesis, this study first collects pairwise day-and-night SVIs across four cities diverged in urban landscapes to construct a comprehensive day-and-night SVI dataset. It then trains and validates a day-to-night (D2N) model with fine-tuned brightness adjustment, effectively transforming daytime SVIs to nighttime ones for distinct urban forms tailored for urban scene perception studies. Our findings indicate that: (1) the performance of D2N transformation varies significantly by urban-scape variations related to urban density; (2) the proportion of building and sky views are important determinants of transformation accuracy; (3) within prevailed models, CycleGAN maintains the consistency of D2N scene conversion, but requires abundant data. Pix2Pix achieves considerable accuracy when pairwise day–and–night-night SVIs are available and are sensitive to data quality. StableDiffusion yields high-quality images with expensive training costs. Therefore, CycleGAN is most effective in balancing the accuracy, data requirement, and cost.

It uses computer-aided generative methods, such as evolutionary optimization and deep generative models, to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and automatically generate design options that satisfy conflicting objectives and various constraints. GUD experiments have attracted much attention from academia, practitioners, and public authorities in recent years. However, a systematic review of the current stage of GUD research is lacking. This study, therefore, reports on a systematic investigation of the existing literature according to the three key stages in the GUD process: (1) design problem formulation, (2) design option generation, and (3) decision-making. For each stage, current trends, findings, and limitations from GUD studies are examined. Future directions and potential challenges are discussed and presented. The review is highly interdisciplinary and involves articles from urban study, computer science, social science, management, and other fields. It reports what scholars have found in GUD experiments and organizes a diverse and complicated technical agenda into something accessible to all stakeholders. The results and discoveries will serve as a holistic reference for GUD developers and users in both academia and industry and form a baseline for the field of GUD development in the coming years.', 'author_keywords': ['AI-generated content (AIGC)', 'Generative AI', 'Generative method', 'Generative urban design', 'Human-machine collaboration', 'Urban form generation'], 'subject_areas': ['Geography, Planning and Development']}, {'title': 'Privacy preserving machine unlearning for smart cities', 'authors': 'Chen K.', 'journal': 'Annales des Telecommunications/Annals of Telecommunications', 'doi': '10.1007/s12243-023-00960-z', 'publication_date': '2024', 'document_type': 'Article', 'scopus_id': '85153583972', 'abstract': 'Due to emerging concerns about public and private privacy issues in smart cities, many countries and organizations are establishing laws and regulations (e.g., GPDR) to protect the data security.

The second one is called machine unlearning. One naive method for machine unlearning is to retrain a new model after data removal.

Existing approaches often rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Transformers to extract agent interaction features. However, they tend to neglect how the distance and velocity information between agents impact their interactions dynamically. Moreover, previous methods use RNNs or first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics, which may lack interpretability with respect to how each agent is driven by interactions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Agent Graph ODE, a novel approach that models agent interactions and continuous second-order dynamics explicitly. Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder architecture, incorporating spatial-temporal Transformers with distance information and dynamic interaction graph construction in the encoder module. In the decoder module, we employ GNNs with distance information to model agent interactions, and use coupled second-order ODEs to capture the underlying continuous dynamics by modeling the relationship between acceleration and agent interactions.

In the field of digital twin smart city, traffic, and water simulation, constructing virtual terrain according to the real terrain can provide the basic environment for subsequent development and experiments. In military simulation, it can quickly build beyond the real scenes of extreme training environment, which has a key role in improving military training and enhancing combat capabilities. Hand-drawn feature sketches can express 3D virtual terrain under human subjective perception. Therefore, how to use hand-drawn feature sketches to build 3D terrain environment quickly and generate realistic virtual geographic environment is a hot spot and difficult point for the creation and development of geographic metaverse with virtual geographic environment as the core in the future. Although the traditional method of generating 3D virtual terrain provides an important reference for image cross-domain generation from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain, problems such as insufficient realism of the generated terrain remain. Especially when the terrain feature outline is too sparse, the generated terrain will have duplicate terrain blocks and grid artifacts. On this basis, a hand-drawn feature sketch virtual terrain generation method with improved generative adversarial network is proposed. The model is based on extracted data samples and hand-drawn sketch characteristics, and the input terrain feature information is involved in the sampling of each layer by improving the generator U-Net network, which enhances the control role of terrain features in the invisible space, reduces the possibility of model collapse, increases the random noise input, and improves the realism of the generated terrain, especially the detail when the terrain feature elements in the sketch are sparse. L1 loss (mean absolute value error function) and L2 loss (mean variance error function) are combined to form smooth L1 loss, and then optimized with CGAN loss function to form a new generator loss function to improve the stability and efficiency of model training. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of some areas of the Loess Plateau with high accuracy is selected to produce data. The DEM data with high accuracy are selected and used for model training to compare and evaluate the terrain generation enhancement effect quantitatively before and after model improvement. Finally, the model inference process from hand-drawn feature sketch to virtual terrain is completely constructed. The experimental results show the improved virtual terrain generation model with the Loess Plateau terrain data can represent the hand-drawn feature sketch well, and the generated terrain conforms to the distribution and orientation of the terrain features described in the sketch, especially in the case of sparse sketch, and the generated terrain has high realistic surface details.

This technique effectively reduces the dimensionality of the state space, resulting in enhanced training efficiency. The multimodal state space consists of vector states, including velocity and position, which the vehicle's intrinsic sensors can readily obtain. Additionally, latent vectors derived from high-quality images are incorporated to facilitate the Agent's assessment of the present trajectory.

The result is a significant boost in prediction accuracy, with Mean Square Error (MSE) reduced to 0.000346 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to 0.00685. Compared to benchmarks, our model improves MSE and MAE by up to 95.45% with respect to the ARIMA model and 87.31% with respect to the NARNN model respectively. User privacy remains a cornerstone of our approach, crucial for smart city applications. Our predictive capabilities enable more efficient resource allocation by service providers, increasing communication infrastructure reliability. Although tailored for smart cities, the approach is adaptable to other fields facing data scarcity and privacy concerns.

First, an urban metro section flow sequence is decomposed using EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) into several IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions) and a trend function. The sum of all the IMF components is treated as the periodic component, and the trend function is considered the trend component, which are fitted by Fourier series function and spline interpolation, respectively. By subtracting the sum of the periodic and trend components from the urban metro section flow sequence, the error is regarded as the residual component. Finally, a GAN (generative adversarial network) based on the fusion graph convolutional neural network is used to predict the new residual component, which considers the spatial correlation between different sites of urban metro sections.

Furthermore, existing image synthesis methods encounter difficulties in preserving high-frequency details and artificial regular structures, which are essential for achieving realistic façade texture synthesis. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for synthesizing façade texture images that authentically reflect the architectural style from a structured label map, guided by a ground-truth façade image.

Some other studies aim to predict OD flow among regions but they fail to model dynamic changes of urban flow over time. In this work, we study a new problem of urban flow generation that generates dynamic urban flow for regions without historical flow data. To capture the effect of multiple factors on urban flow, such as region features and urban environment, we employ diffusion model to generate urban flow for regions under different conditions. We first construct an urban knowledge graph (UKG) to model the urban environment and relationships between regions, based on which we design a knowledge-enhanced spatio-temporal diffusion model (KSTDiff) to generate urban flow for each region. Specifically, to accurately generate urban flow for regions with different flow volumes, we design a novel diffusion process guided by a volume estimator, which is learnable and customized for each region.

Automatic recognition of human activity in aerial videos captured by drones is critical for various tasks for these applications. However, this is difficult due to many factors specific to aerial views, including camera motion, vibration, low resolution, background clutter, lighting conditions, and variations in view. Although deep learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in a variety of challenging vision tasks, they require either a large number of labelled aerial videos for training or a dataset with balanced classes, both of which can be difficult to obtain. To address these challenges, a hybrid data augmentation method is proposed which combines data transformation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based feature augmentation method. In particular, we apply the basic transformation methods to increase the amount of video in the database.

The proposed approach consists of four main steps: image segmentation into homogeneous superpixels using a modified Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC), in-depth feature extraction using an variational auto-encoder (VAE) scale on the superpixels for training and testing data collection, identification of four classes (buildings, roads, trees, and shadows) using extracted feature data as input to an Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and extraction of building shapes through regional growth and morphological operations.

In this paper, we exploit the idea of a training model based on the “Cloze Test” strategy in natural language processing (NLP) and introduce a novel unsupervised learning framework to encode both motion and appearance information at an object level. Specifically, to store the normal modes of video activity reconstructions, we first design an optical stream memory network with skip connections. Secondly, we build a space–time cube (STC) for use as the basic processing unit of the model and erase a patch in the STC to form the frame to be reconstructed. This enables a so-called ”incomplete event (IE)” to be completed. On this basis, a conditional autoencoder is utilized to capture the high correspondence between optical flow and STC. The model predicts erased patches in IEs based on the context of the front and back frames. Finally, we employ a generating adversarial network (GAN)-based training method to improve the performance of VAD. By distinguishing the predicted erased optical flow and erased video frame, the anomaly detection results are shown to be more reliable with our proposed method which can help reconstruct the original video in IE.

First, collecting ground truth labels or prior knowledge for anomalies is hard in real-world systems, which often lead to limited or no anomaly labels in the dataset. Second, anomalies in large systems usually occur in a collective manner due to the underlying dependency structure among devices or sensors. Lastly, real-time anomaly detection for high-dimensional data requires efficient algorithms that are capable of handling different types of data (i.e. continuous and discrete). We propose a correlation structure-based collective anomaly detection (CSCAD) model for high-dimensional anomaly detection problem in large systems, which is also generalizable to semi-supervised or supervised settings. Our framework utilize graph convolutional network combining a variational autoencoder to jointly exploit the feature space correlation and reconstruction deficiency of samples to perform anomaly detection. We propose an extended mutual information (EMI) metric to mine the internal correlation structure among different data features, which enhances the data reconstruction capability of CSCAD. The reconstruction loss and latent standard deviation vector of a sample obtained from reconstruction network can be perceived as two natural anomalous degree measures. An anomaly discriminating network can then be trained using low anomalous degree samples as positive samples, and high anomalous degree samples as negative samples.

It can assist a driver in selecting the most efficient route to their destination. The digitalization of closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems has resulted in more effective and capable surveillance imaging systems for security applications. The number of automobiles on the world’s highways has steadily increased in recent decades. However, road capacity has not developed at the same rate, resulting in significantly increasing congestion. The model learning mechanism cannot be guided or improved by prior domain knowledge of real-world problems. In reality, symmetrical features are common in many real-world research objects. To mitigate this severe situation, the researchers chose adaptive traffic management to make intelligent and efficient use of the current infrastructure. Data grow exponentially and become a complex item that must be managed. Unstructured data are a subset of big data that are difficult to process and have volatile properties. CCTV cameras are used in traffic management to monitor a specific point on the roadway. CCTV generates unstructured data in the form of images and videos. Because of the data’s intricacy, these data are challenging to process. This study proposes using big data analytics to transform real-time unstructured data from CCTV into information that can be shown on a web dashboard. As a Hadoop-based architectural stack that can serve as the ICT backbone for managing unstructured data efficiently, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores several sorts of data using the Hadoop file storage system, a high-performance integrated virtual environment (HIVE) tables, and non-relational storage. Traditional computer vision algorithms are incapable of processing such massive amounts of visual data collected in real-time. However, the inferiority of traffic data and the quality of unit information are always symmetrical phenomena. As a result, there is a need for big data analytics with machine learning, which entails processing and analyzing vast amounts of visual data, such as photographs or videos, to uncover semantic patterns that may be interpreted. As a result, smart cities require a more accurate traffic flow prediction system.

While methods to assess solar irradiation, especially on rooftops, are well established, the assessment on building facades usually involves a higher effort due to more complex urban features and obstructions. The drawback of existing physics-based simulation programs are that they require significant manual modeling effort and computing time for generating time resolved deterministic results. Yet, solar irradiation is highly intermittent and representing its inherent uncertainty may be required for designing robust BIPV energy systems. Targeting on these drawbacks, this paper proposes a data-driven model based on Deep Generative Networks (DGN) to efficiently generate stochastic ensembles of annual hourly solar irradiance time series on building facades with uncompromised spatiotemporal resolution at the urban scale. The only input required are easily obtainable fisheye images as categorical shading masks captured from 3D models. In principle, even actual photographs of urban contexts can be utilized, given they are semantically segmented. The potential of our approach is that it may be applied as a surrogate for time-consuming simulations, when facing lacking information (e.g., no 3D model exists), and to use the generated stochastic time-series ensembles in robust energy systems planning. Our validations exemplify a good fidelity of the generated time series when compared to the physics-based simulator. Due to the nature of the used DGNs, it remains an open challenge to precisely reconstruct the ground truth one-to-one for each hour of the year.

As an important part of smart cities, smart water environmental protection has become an important way to solve water environmental pollution problems. It is proposed in this article to develop a water quality remote sensing image analysis and prediction method based on the improved Pix2Pix (3D-GAN) model to overcome the problems associated with water environment prediction of smart cities based on remote sensing image data having low accuracy in predicting image information, as well as being difficult to train. Methods. Firstly, due to inversion differences and weather conditions, water quality remote sensing images are not perfect, which leads to the creation of time series data that cannot be used directly in prediction modeling. Therefore, a method for preprocessing time series of remote sensing images has been proposed in this article. The original remote sensing image was unified by pixel substitution, the image was repaired by spatial weight matrix, and the time series data was supplemented by linear interpolation. Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the prediction model to process spatial-temporal data and improve the prediction accuracy of remote sensing images, the convolutional gated recurrent unit network is concatenated with the Unet network as the generator of the improved Pix2Pix model. At the same time, the channel attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional gated recurrent unit network to enhance the ability of extracting image time series information, and the residual structure is introduced into the downsampling of the U-net network to avoid gradient explosion or disappearance. After that, the remote sensing images of historical moments are superimposed on the channels as labels and sent to the discriminator for adversarial training. The improved Pix2Pix model no longer translates images, but can predict two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, so it is actually a 3D-GAN model. Third, remote sensing image inversion data of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Taihu Lake basin are used to verify and predict the water environment at future moments. Results. The results show that the mean value of structural similarity, peak signal-tonoise ratio, cosine similarity, and mutual information between the predicted value of the proposed method and the real remote sensing image is higher than that of existing methods, which indicates that the proposed method is effective in predicting water environment of smart cities', 'author_keywords': ['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Image analysis', 'Neural network', 'Pix2Pix model', 'Prediction', 'Remote sensing', 'Smart cities', 'Spatial-temporal data', 'Water environment'], 'subject_areas': ['Computer Science (all)']}, {'title': 'Machine Learning for Relaying Topology: Optimization of IoT Networks with Energy Harvesting', 'authors': 'Chung K.', 'journal': 'IEEE Access', 'doi': '10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3270631', 'publication_date': '2023', 'document_type': 'Article', 'scopus_id': '85159658842', 'abstract': 'In this paper, we examine Internet of Things (IoT) systems related to smart cities, smart factories, connected cars, etc. To support such systems in a wide area with low power consumption, energy harvesting technology utilizing wireless charging infrastructure is necessary for the longevity of networks.

Existing methods are often over- or under-segmented when segmenting overlapping street tree canopies and extracting geometrically complex trees. To address this problem, we propose a method based on improved 3-D morphological analysis for extracting street trees from mobile laser scanner (MLS) point clouds. First, the 3-D semantic point cloud segmentation framework based on deep learning is used for preclassification of the original point cloud to obtain the vegetation point cloud in the scene. Considering the influence of terrain unevenness, the vegetation point cloud is deterraformed and slice point cloud containing tree trunks is obtained through spatial filtering on height. On this basis, a voxel-based region growing method constrained with the changing rate of convex area is used to locate the stree trees. Then we propose a progressive tree crown segmentation method, which first completed the preliminary individual segmentation of the tree crown point cloud based on the voxel-based region growth constrained by the minimum increment rule, and then optimizes the crown edges by 'valley' structure-based clustering. In this article, the proposed method is validated and the accuracy is evaluated using three sets of MLS datasets collected from different scenarios. The experimental results show that the method can effectively identify and localize street trees with different geometries and has a good segmentation effect for street trees with large adhesion between canopies.

This eGAN model can utilize ambient intelligence, a human-centered technology that includes IoT, smart cities, and autonomous driving. Ambient intelligence is essential for the interconnection between humans and objects. The eGAN model was used to make this connectivity more accurate and reliable. Edge detection is an edge feature that extracts the boundaries of an image and generate images in a fast manner; however, because its threshold is arbitrarily set, the connectivity may be unstable. To solve this problem and improve the performance of the eGAN model, we analyzed various GAN models and edge detection methods and proposed a new edge detection technology using threshold settings. This edge detection method sets the threshold value for images, thereby increasing the accuracy of edge connection and reducing the loss error between the image generated by the eGAN model and actual image. To evaluate the performance of the eGAN model, the error between the generated image and actual image was compared by applying the GAN and eGAN models to the same image dataset.

Population synthesis provides a means to scale this microdata to represent larger regions for use in microsimulation. Despite their accuracy and widespread adoption, traditional synthesis algorithms for reweighting microdata samples scale poorly with the number of variables and geographic regions being modeled, and can suffer from non-convergence with smaller sample sizes. Several generative models have been proposed to address these shortcomings, but lack features such as sub-region modeling, and the ability to simultaneously generate both individuals and households. This work proposes an extension to recent generative approaches capable of generating synthetic populations consisting of both individual and household-level variables, that uses a two-part Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Conditional-VAE (CVAE) to learn a distribution of latent variables in the general population, and use them to generate new samples. This can help in synthesizing smaller, traditionally under-sampled groups. This approach is benchmarked against a state of the art open source population synthesizer. In addition, the VAE/CVAE model is tested under increasingly minimal training data. Findings indicate the VAE/CVAE model creates more accurate populations, using less time than the traditional synthesizer under small to medium dimensional datasets (4–16 variables).

However, it is been discovered that DNNs are broadly vulnerable to maliciously constructed adversarial examples. By adding small perturbations to a query image, the returned retrieval results will be completely dissimilar from the query image. This poses serious challenges to vital systems in Smart City applications that depend on the DNN-based visual retrieval technology, as in the physical world, simple camouflage can be added on the subject (a few patches on the body or car), and turn the subject completely untrackable by person or vehicle Re-ID systems.

Therefore, a semi-supervised learning method that extracts effective features from a large amount of unlabeled data by learning a small amount of labeled data becomes a potential way to solve such problems. To address the problems of complex background of remote sensing images and the inability of supervised scene classification algorithms to utilize unlabeled data, a semi-supervised remote sensing image scene classification method based on generative adversarial networks, namely, residual attention generative adversarial networks, is proposed. First, to enhance the stability of training, the residual blocks with jump structure are introduced in the deep neural network. At the same time, the spectral normalization constrains the spectral norm of the weight matrix in each convolutional layer of the residual block to ensure that the input and output of each batch of data satisfy the 1-Lipschitz continuity, which makes the generative adversarial training always smooth, not only improves the training stability, but also avoids network degradation. Secondly, since the shallow features extracted by the bottom convolution contain mostly local information and low semantics, while the deep features extracted by the top convolution contain more global information but lose part of the detail information. Therefore, the shallow features are fused with the deep features extracted from the multi-layer spectral normalized residual blocks to reduce the loss of features and allow the model to learn the complementary relationships between different features, thus improving the model's representational ability. Finally, to guide the model to focus more purposefully on important features and suppress unnecessary features, an attention module that mimics the signal processing of the human brain is used. Meanwhile, in order to obtain stronger feature representation ability and capture the dependency relationship between features, a gating mechanism is introduced to form an attention module combined with gating. To verify the superiority of the method, experiments were conducted on two high-resolution remote sensing image datasets, EuroSAT and UC Merced. In the EuroSAT dataset, the highest classification accuracy reached 93.3% and 97.4% when the number of labeled features was 2 000 and 21 600, respectively. In the UC Merced dataset, the classification accuracies reached 85.7% and 91.0% when the number of labeled was 400 and 1 680, respectively. To further validate the degree of contribution of each module, ablation experiments were also conducted in the EuroSAT and UCM public datasets, and it can be concluded from the validation that the spectral normalization residual module has the largest contribution, with improvement for different number of labeled samples. The reason is that the spectral normalization ensures that the gradient of the network is limited to a certain range during backpropagation, improving the stability of the generative adversarial network, and also does not destroy the network structure in the process. The next is the attention module combined with gating, especially when the labeled sample size is greater than 10%, the classification effect is improved more because the sample size is sufficient to learn more comprehensive features. The smallest contribution is the feature fusion module, because when the sample size is very small, the network is not sufficiently trained and learned, and a part of redundant or invalid features are extracted, resulting in lower classification accuracy. The above experimental results show that the proposed residual attention generation adversarial network classification method can effectively extract more discriminative features and improve the semi-supervised classification performance for the problem of small sample size of labeled high-resolution remote sensing images, which makes it difficult to extract discriminative features.\", 'author_keywords': ['Attention mechanism', 'Generative Adversarial network', 'Remote sensing image', 'Scene classification', 'Semi-supervised'], 'subject_areas': ['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics']}, {'title': 'Automatic generation of architecture facade for historical urban renovation using generative adversarial network', 'authors': 'Sun C.', 'journal': 'Building and Environment', 'doi': '10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108781', 'publication_date': '2022', 'document_type': 'Article', 'scopus_id': '85122940920', 'abstract': 'In architecture, urban culture inheritance plays a nontrivial role in the urban renovation of a city.

To address this challenge, this article develops a disentangled representation learning framework to learn an interpretable factorized representation of the independent data generative factors. In order to make full use of the knowledge on generative factors, this article proposes spatial-temporal generative adversarial network (ST-GAN) to assign the generative factors of traffic flow to the feature vector in latent space and reconstructs the high-dimensional citywide traffic flow from the given factors.

Geodetector(Origin version,Beijing,PR China) is a great tool for analysis of spatial differentiation and its influencing factors, and it provides decision support for differentiated policy design and its implementation in executing the city-specific policies. Using factor detection and interaction analysis of Geodetector, 15 indicators of economic, social, ecological, and environmental dimensions were integrated, and 143 cities were selected for the empirical research in China. The research shows that, first of all, risks of both infection and death show positive spatial autocorrelation, but the geographical distribution of local spatial autocorrelation differs significantly between the two. Secondly, the inequalities in urban economic, social, and residential environments interact with COVID-19 spatial heterogeneity, with stronger explanatory power especially when multidimensional inequalities are superimposed.

A sustainable city is normally designed in such a way to consider the environmental impact and a social, economic, and resilient habitat for existing populations without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same, while the process of managing project requirements is known as requirements management. To design a high-quality project, effective requirements management is imperative. A number of techniques are already available to perform the requirement gathering process, and software developers apply them to collect the requirements. Nevertheless, they are facing many issues in gathering requirements due to a lack of literature on the selection of appropriate methods, which affects the quality of the software.

Objective: Assess and compare risk of exposure to fecal contamination via multiple pathways in ten cities. Methods: In total, 4053 environmental samples, 4586 household surveys, 128 community surveys, and 124 school surveys were collected. E. coli concentrations were measured in environmental samples as an indicator of fecal contamination magnitude. Bayesian methods were used to estimate the distributions of fecal contamination concentration and contact frequency. Exposure to fecal contamination was estimated by the Monte Carlo method. The contamination levels of ten environmental compartments, frequency of contact with those compartments for adults and children, and estimated exposure to fecal contamination through any of the surveyed environmental pathways were compared across cities and neighborhoods. Results: Distribution of fecal contamination in the environment and human contact behavior varied by city. Universally, food pathways were the most common dominant route of exposure to fecal contamination across cities in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Risks of fecal exposure via water pathways, such as open drains, flood water, and municipal drinking water, were site-specific and often limited to smaller geographic areas (i.e., neighborhoods) instead of larger areas (i.e., cities). Conclusions: Knowledge of the relative contribution to fecal exposure from multiple pathways, and the environmental contamination level and frequency of contact for those “dominant pathways” could provide guidance for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) programming and investments and enable local governments and municipalities to improve intervention strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to fecal contamination.', 'author_keywords': ['Exposure assessment', 'Fecal', 'LLMIC', 'Multi-city', 'Pathway', 'WASH'], 'subject_areas': ['Environmental Engineering', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management and Disposal', 'Pollution']}, {'title': 'PERCEIVING FABRIC IMMERSED IN TIME An Exploration of Urban Cognitive Capabilities of Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Dong Z.', 'journal': 'Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia', 'doi': '10.52842/conf.caadria.2022.1.263', 'publication_date': '2022', 'document_type': 'Conference Paper', 'scopus_id': '85189183415', 'abstract': 'City develops gradually with the lapse of time.

Existing physics-based solar simulation engines require significant manual modelling effort and computing time to obtain high-resolution deterministic results.

Yet, neighboring effect is contingent on the home city's existing pro-environmental policy propensity. However, in contrast to conventional wisdom, this study finds no evidence that local environmental advocacy groups play a crucial role in the diffusion of municipal climate initiatives.

This paper addresses the problem from the perspective of data enhancement. A model for generating underground space data based on a variational autoencoder is proposed. The model maps data of the thermal comfort of an underground space to a highly compressed latent layer space and generates data in an unsupervised manner.

This study presents the inclusion of hydrological processes in a computationally-efficient urban micro-climate model, the Vertical City Weather Generator (VCWG v2.0.0). VCWG v2.0.0 accounts for not only the interaction between indoor and outdoor environments through parameterizations including building energy, surface energy balance, radiation, and vertical diffusion models, but also the biophysical and ecophysiological behavior of urban vegetation via an advanced hydrology model. VCWG v2.0.0 is evaluated against field measurements from Basel, Switzerland, in 2002, and Vancouver, Canada, in 2008. The model outperforms the previous version by reducing the RMSE of potential temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity by 0.5 K, 0.52 m s−1, and 0.001 kg kg−1, respectively. Inclusion of the hydrology model also improves prediction of sensible/latent heat fluxes with RMSE of 18.1/27.7 W m−2 for the Vancouver case. VCWG v2.0.0 is further assessed by explorations related to seasonal variations, modification of ground vegetation, green and cool roofs, and changes in the Local Climate Zone (LCZ), which are all in reasonable agreement with models and observations in previous studies.

Additionally, the model runs at a real-time speed and the average run time for one operation is less than 12 milliseconds. The protection can be deployed for both local images and streaming videos. The data privacy protection is based on our proposed concept of the Sensitivity Maps, which summarizes the effectiveness and efficiency of adding noises on each pixel on the original image to interfere with the target model's performance. We have built a new dataset of facial images containing 102 celebrities for the proposed model to be trained and evaluated. The experimental results prove the advantage of the proposed method against protecting the identity information in facial images.\", 'author_keywords': ['Face Recognition', 'GAN', 'Privacy'], 'subject_areas': ['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Control and Optimization', 'Communication']}, {'title': 'AirGen: GAN-based synthetic data generator for air monitoring in Smart City', 'authors': 'Le Minh K.H.', 'journal': '6th International Forum on Research and Technology for Society and Industry, RTSI 2021 - Proceedings', 'doi': '10.1109/RTSI50628.2021.9597364', 'publication_date': '2021', 'document_type': 'Conference Paper', 'scopus_id': '85123177659', 'abstract': 'The past decade has seen a notable increase in air pollution that directly damages health, animals, and plants worldwide.

In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen.

Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building façade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the façade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and façade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building façades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality.

In previous studies, LUCC prediction models have been mainly based on cellular automata structures that calculate a future state pixel by pixel through transition rules. Because these transition rules are usually based on the global state and each pixel is calculated according to these fixed rules, the results of these methods have room for improvement in terms of generating details and heterogeneity. In this article, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based LUCC prediction model using multiscale local spatial information is proposed. The model is based on a pix2pix GAN and an attention structure that predicts future land use through multiscale local spatial information. To validate our model, Shenzhen, a region that is experiencing rapid urbanization, was chosen as the source of the experimental data.

While the early forms of artificial neural networks were aimed at simulating and understanding human cognition, contemporary deep neural networks are totally indifferent to cognitive studies, they are designed with pure engineering goals in mind. Several scholars, we included, argue that it urges to reconnect artificial modeling with an updated knowledge of how complex tasks are realized by the human mind and brain. In this paper, we will first try to distill concepts within neuroscience and cognitive science relevant for the driving behavior. Then, we will identify possible algorithmic counterparts of such concepts, and finally build an artificial neural model exploiting these components for the visual perception task of an autonomous vehicle. More specifically, we will point to four neurocognitive theories: the simulation theory of cognition; the Convergence–divergence Zones hypothesis; the transformational abstraction hypothesis; the free–energy predictive theory.

Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment.

This number is equivalent to the population of Europe or Africa added to the populations of Australia, North America, and Central America. It is one of the few populous countries in the world, and its huge population size has brought many problems. With the rapid development of the economy, the number of people working outside of their homes is increasing, the population is moving frequently, and the safety of the floating population is even difficult to control. The huge mobile population provides the city's infrastructure and public services tremendous pressure. Thus, to conduct a comprehensive check on the area of adult traffic, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, is difficult for security and related staff. Particularly, complex environmental safety problems, such as subways, railway stations, and airports, are becoming increasingly serious. Unstable events occur frequently, security situation is receiving much attention, and urban management and service systems are seriously lagging behind. These conditions need to be improved, especially after the September 11 incident in the United States. The situation has aroused widespread concern in the international community. Meanwhile, expression is the most intuitive way for humans to express emotions. In addition to language communication, expressions are extremely effective means of communication. People usually express their inner feelings through specific expressions. Expression can be used to judge other person's thoughts. For expressions used to express information, psychologist Mehrabian summed up a formula: emotional expression = 7% of words + 38% of sound + 55% of facial expressions. Expression is one of the most important features of human emotion recognition. Expression is the emotional state expressed by facial muscle changes. Through the facial expression of the person's face, to evaluate abnormal psychological state, speculate on extreme emotions, and observe the facial expressions of pedestrians in the subway, railway station, and airport to further judge the psychology of the person is possible. We provide technical support to determine who is suspicious and prevent certain criminal activities in a timely manner. Strengthening urban surveillance and identifying the facial expressions of criminals are especially important. Expression plays an important role in human emotion cognition. However, factors affecting facial expression recognition in safety screening are extremely large, and the large intra-class gap seriously inflluences the accuracy of facial expression recognition. The problem of large gaps in facial expression recognition in a real environment is solved by identifying suspected molecules to be monitored should be identified, and the security personnel should prepare in advance to accurately identify them. Facial expressions are also particularly important for preventing security problems. The era of large data has arrived. Meanwhile, with the advancement of computer hardware, deep learning continues to develop. The traditional facial expression recognition method cannot meet the needs of the development of the times, and a new algorithm based on deep learning facial expression recognition is coming soon. Learning methods are widely used in facial expression recognition. Although facial recognition intelligent recognition technology has a long history of research, a large number of research methods have been proposed. However, due to the large facial expression gap, the expression is complex, and the influencing factors are many. The current intelligent recognition effect of facial expression results is not ideal. Considering the deep learning because of its powerful expressive ability, this study introduces the model structure of traditional neural network and carries out corresponding experiments and analysis in the context of real-life facial expression recognition and proposes real-world facial expression recognition research based on deep learning. In the next period, real-world facial expression recognition will make considerable progress. This work further studies the realistic facial expression recognition based on deep learning. Method: This study constructs a new IC-GAN(intra-class gap GAN(generative adversarial network)) recognition network model, providing good adaptability to the facial expression recognition task with large gap within the class. The network consists of a convolutional layer, a fully connected layer, an active layer, a BathNorm layer, and a Softmax layer, in which a convolutional assembly encoder and a decoder are used to perform deep feature extraction on facial expression images, and download and parse from the network. The video self-made mixed facial expression data set is based on the real environment, the image is expanded, and the facial expression data are normalized. The complexity of the facial expression features with large differences within the class also increased the network training and network recognition. The momentum-based Adam is used to update the network weight, adjust the network parameters, and optimize the network structure based on this factor. In this study, the facial expression category data are trained based on the Pytorch platform in deep learning and tested on the verification set of the self-made mixed facial expression data set. Result: When the input image is 256 × 256 pixels, the IC-GAN network model can reduce the false positive rate of the expression in large difference in the class, image blur, and facial expression incompleteness, and improve the system robustness. Compared with deep belief network(DBN) deep trust network and GoogLeNet network, the recognition result of IC-GAN network is 11% higher than that of DBN network and 8.3% higher than that of GoogLeNet network. Conclusion: The IC-GAN accuracy in facial expression recognition with large gaps in the class is verified by experiments. This condition reduces the misunderstanding rate of facial expressions in large intra-class differences, improves the system robustness, and lays down the solid foundation for facial expression generation.\", 'author_keywords': ['Deep learning', 'Facial expression recognition', 'Generative adversarial network(GAN)', 'Intra-class gap GAN(IC-GAN)'], 'subject_areas': ['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction']}, {'title': 'A novel approach to simulate pollutant dispersion in the built environment: Transport-based recurrence CFD', 'authors': 'Du Y.', 'journal': 'Building and Environment', 'doi': '10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106604', 'publication_date': '2020', 'document_type': 'Article', 'scopus_id': '85077169876', 'abstract': 'The large-scale practical application of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) for predicting long-term wind flow and pollutant dispersion in urban areas is inhibited mainly by the associated very large computational costs. To overcome this difficulty, the present study, for the first time, applies transport-based recurrence Computational Fluid Dynamics (rCFD) to simulate atmospheric pollutant dispersion around a building. A novel diffusion model is proposed to accurately predict pollutant transport with rCFD. To illustrate the feasibility and advantages of rCFD, pollutant dispersion around an isolated cubical building with a rooftop vent, immersed in neutral atmospheric boundary layer flow is used as a case study and both LES and rCFD simulations are conducted. It is shown that rCFD simulation results agree well with those from LES both in terms of mean and fluctuating concentrations while the simulation wall-clock time drops from 222 h to 16 min. The application of four evaluation metrics (FAC2, FB, NMSE and R) indicates very good agreement between LES and rCFD results. Another major advantage of rCFD is that different pollutant events can be simulated promptly once the database has been stored for a given flow configuration, as shown by the comparison of LES and rCFD results for two other cases with different release locations. This study extends the application of transport-based rCFD to pollutant dispersion in the built environment and indicates that rCFD is a promising approach to facilitate the large-scale practical application of LES for this type of applications.', 'author_keywords': ['Large eddy simulation (LES)', 'Novel diffusion model', 'Pollutant dispersion', 'Transport-based recurrence CFD (rCFD)', 'Urban environment'], 'subject_areas': ['Environmental Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Building and Construction']}, {'title': 'The modified smart city concept for Russian municipalities in the context of change management', 'authors': 'Komarevtseva O.O.', 'journal': 'R-Economy', 'doi': '10.15826/recon.2020.6.4.026', 'publication_date': '2020', 'document_type': 'Article', 'scopus_id': '85147666454', 'abstract': 'Relevance. Outdated tools and instruments for development and governance prevent the effective use of data and digital platforms in Russian cities, thus creating obstacles for the implementation of smart new solutions.

The relevance of this study is determined by the need to adjust the smart city concept for municipal economy in Russia and to propose a modified version of this concept. Research objective. This study aims at creating a modified smart city concept by changing evaluation criteria and using a simulation model of municipal economy. Results. The study found that the established smart city concept is not entirely suitable for implementation in Russian municipalities.

To tackle these challenges, we are stimulated by the deep-learning method proposed to unlock the power of knowledge from urban computing and proposed a deep-learning model based on neural network, entitled Capsules TCN Network, to predict the traffic flow in local areas of the city at once. Capsules TCN Network employs a Capsules Network and Temporal Convolutional Network as the basic unit to learn the spatial dependence, time dependence, and external factors of traffic flow prediction. In specific, we consider some particular scenarios that require accurate traffic flow prediction (e.g., smart transportation, business circle analysis, and traffic flow assessment) and propose a GAN-based superresolution reconstruction model. Extensive experiments were conducted based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of Capsules TCN Network beyond several state-of-the-art methods.

The use of smart meters in cities requires temporary high-resolution data to improve the energy efficiency (EE) of SLs. Long range (LoRa) is an ideal wireless protocol for use in smart cities due to its low energy consumption, secure communications, and long range indoors and outdoors. For this purpose, we developed a low-cost new system and successfully evaluated it by developing three devices, namely the measure and control device for street lights (MCDSL), lighting level measurement device (LLMD) and gateway LoRa network (GWLN), based on the Arduino open-source electronic platform. This paper describes the hardware and software design and its implementation. Further, an algorithm has been developed to enhance the energy efficiency of public lights using MCDSL, the energy efficiency for street lights (EESL) algorithm, that use the illumination level measured on the same set of SLs with a dynamic control, which assumed different lighting levels throughout the night, and adjusted luminous flux based on the traffic intensity of pedestrians.

However, limiting factors related to technology, market and policy could impede their adoption. The objective of this research is to forecast how the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) will happen in India and the crucial elements that would influence adoption. The research outcomes are expected to help policy makers to optimally phase investments and incentives earmarked for public charging infrastructure. ‘Bass diffusion model’ has been used as the base for preparing a system dynamics model using Vensim software to forecast the diffusion of EV’s from 2017 to 2030. Consumer willingness to purchase EV’s has been elicited through a survey conducted among 50 respondents, who drive 4-wheelers. Adoption has been modeled considering the effect of 4 parameters on consumer willingness to purchase EV, namely- price differential between EV’s and ICE vehicles, range, recharge time and charging infrastructure density. The model output indicates an S-shaped diffusion curve with saturation near the 50th month. Out of the four parameters, adoption is found to be highly sensitive to charging infrastructure density. The paper concludes that there is a high scope of optimizing government investment in charging infrastructure which would require a detailed view of technical, policy and market related aspects.', 'author_keywords': ['Consumer willingness', 'Diffusion', 'Electric vehicle', 'Price differential', 'Recharge time'], 'subject_areas': ['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering']}]\n"
