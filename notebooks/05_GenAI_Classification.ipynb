         "Problem: Modernizing and standardizing place names and addresses is a key challenge in the development of smart cities. Purpose: This paper proposes a solution to address matching challenges, such as incomplete descriptions, reversed word order, and the diverse descriptions often found in Chinese addresses. Method: Leveraging the hierarchical structure of Chinese addresses, this study introduces the interactive address matching graph attention model (IAMGAM). In the IAMGAM, an attention-based feature interaction method (AFIM) is employed. To reflect the hierarchical nature of address elements, a directed graph is used to model the address data, and the model is trained and tested using a graph attention mechanism. Results: Experiments demonstrate that the IAMGAM achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 99.61%. Compared with the existing address matching methods, the IAMGAM improves the accuracy by 0.66% to 2.57%, and the F1-score by 0.68% to 2.55%, outperforming baseline models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component within the model. Furthermore, when fine-tuned using ChatGLM2-6B, the results show that the IAMGAM still outperforms ChatGLM2-6B. Conclusion: IAMGAM demonstrates excellent performance in Chinese address matching tasks, and the Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods, such as ChatGLM2-6B, show great potential for future development in this area.",

Therefore, it is crucial to generate pseudo personal mobility data that accurately reflects real-world mobility patterns while safeguarding user privacy. Nevertheless, existing methods for generating pseudo mobility data, mostly focusing on trip or trajectory generation, have limitations in capturing sufficient individual heterogeneity. To address these gaps, taking pseudo-person(avatar) as ground-zero, a novel individual-based human mobility generator named GeoAvatar has been proposed – which considering individual heterogeneity in spatial and temporal decision-making, incorporates demographic characteristics. Our method utilizes a deep generative model to generate heterogeneous individual life patterns, a variation inference model for inferring individual demographic characteristics, and a Bayesian-based approach for generating spatial choices considering individual demographic characteristics. Through our method, we have achieved generating realistic pseudo personal human mobility data - we evaluated the proposed method based on physical features – obeying common law of human mobility, activity features – showing diverse and realistic activities, and spatial-temporal characteristics – presenting high-accuracy in terms of temporal grid population and od-count, demonstrating its good performance, with both a big mobile phone GPS trajectory dataset from Tokyo Metropolis and a big mobile phone CDR dataset from Shanghai. Furthermore, this method maintains extensibility for broader applications, making it a promising framework for generating pseudo personal human mobility data.",

         "Problem: Modernizing and standardizing place names and addresses is a key challenge in the development of smart cities. Purpose: This paper proposes a solution to address matching challenges, such as incomplete descriptions, reversed word order, and the diverse descriptions often found in Chinese addresses. Method: Leveraging the hierarchical structure of Chinese addresses, this study introduces the interactive address matching graph attention model (IAMGAM). In the IAMGAM, an attention-based feature interaction method (AFIM) is employed. To reflect the hierarchical nature of address elements, a directed graph is used to model the address data, and the model is trained and tested using a graph attention mechanism. Results: Experiments demonstrate that the IAMGAM achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 99.61%. Compared with the existing address matching methods, the IAMGAM improves the accuracy by 0.66% to 2.57%, and the F1-score by 0.68% to 2.55%, outperforming baseline models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component within the model. Furthermore, when fine-tuned using ChatGLM2-6B, the results show that the IAMGAM still outperforms ChatGLM2-6B. Conclusion: IAMGAM demonstrates excellent performance in Chinese address matching tasks, and the Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods, such as ChatGLM2-6B, show great potential for future development in this area.",

Therefore, it is crucial to generate pseudo personal mobility data that accurately reflects real-world mobility patterns while safeguarding user privacy. Nevertheless, existing methods for generating pseudo mobility data, mostly focusing on trip or trajectory generation, have limitations in capturing sufficient individual heterogeneity. To address these gaps, taking pseudo-person(avatar) as ground-zero, a novel individual-based human mobility generator named GeoAvatar has been proposed – which considering individual heterogeneity in spatial and temporal decision-making, incorporates demographic characteristics. Our method utilizes a deep generative model to generate heterogeneous individual life patterns, a variation inference model for inferring individual demographic characteristics, and a Bayesian-based approach for generating spatial choices considering individual demographic characteristics. Through our method, we have achieved generating realistic pseudo personal human mobility data - we evaluated the proposed method based on physical features – obeying common law of human mobility, activity features – showing diverse and realistic activities, and spatial-temporal characteristics – presenting high-accuracy in terms of temporal grid population and od-count, demonstrating its good performance, with both a big mobile phone GPS trajectory dataset from Tokyo Metropolis and a big mobile phone CDR dataset from Shanghai.

This study introduces an innovative framework for SAR image colorization, leveraging an Attention-Based WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty). The model incorporates multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction, capture long-range dependencies, and dynamically suppress noise through a novel variance-based attention adjustment mechanism. Extensive evaluations on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets across diverse terrains, including agriculture, urban areas, barren land, and grasslands, demonstrate the model's superiority over existing approaches. It achieves an LPIPS score of 0.27, SSIM of 0.76, and an average inference time of 0.22 s, showcasing its ability to preserve spatial coherence and perceptual quality even in complex, noisy environments.

         "Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) plays a crucial role in achieving social sustainable development goals. Precise information on WWTPs obtained through advanced semantic segmentation technologies benefits multiple applications, including urban planning, environmental protection and public health. However, the diverse architectural styles, scales and surroundings of WWTPs across regions, influenced by climate, topography and regional economic conditions, bring challenges in generalizing segmentation algorithms. Thus, fusing the knowledge learned from different regions can form a more powerful knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose a Skip connection driven Two-stream property fusion Variational AutoEncoder (STVAE) for cross-region WWTP semantic segmentation. Our motivation is to increase the generalization capability of STVAE by capturing and fusing generative probabilistic features, inherent region properties and multi-scale properties. Specifically, STVAE captures the generative probabilistic features by constructing an attention-driven variational encoder. These features make STVAE more adaptable to the cross-domain changes, improving the segmentation robustness and performance. This attention-driven structure contributes to learning local details and limiting the effect of weak semantic information. Furthermore, a two-stream parallel decoder is considered to adapt distributions from different perspectives. The inherent region properties are introduced in this decoder to highlight the spatial consistency of the results. The unsupervised inherent region information and multi-scale features, which are extracted by this decoder, are fused through an entropy-wise mechanism. Additionally, a unique adversarial strategy is utilized to align the distributions of different domains. Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and Microsoft Bing Maps Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images, multiple experiments conducted on three tasks illustrate the effectiveness of STVAE compared with several state-of-the-art techniques qualitatively and quantitatively. STVAE effectively expands its application scope.",

However, these tools are not appropriate for the co-creation of street design solutions mainly due to the demanding work to create complex designs, the lack of multi-user interfaces, and the inability to create visualizations in real-time. Recently, a few generative AI tools such as UrbanistAI, PlacemakingAI, and Laneform have been developed to overcome these limitations, generating real-time street layout visualizations. These tools aim to enhance stakeholder and citizen involvement in street design processes by allowing citizens to easily modify street layouts and visualize how the street could be in the future. Even though these tools may increase efficiency in design generation, their possible impacts and integration into urban planning practices are poorly questioned and studied. This viewpoint aims to outline a research agenda, discussing the challenges and potential positive and negative effects of using generative AI in participatory decision-making for street designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that discusses the possible benefits and impacts of these generative AI tools for generating future street design.

         "The concept of Digital Twins (DT) has attracted significant attention across various domains, particularly within the built environment. However, there is a sheer volume of definitions and the terminological consensus remains out of reach. The lack of a universally accepted definition leads to ambiguities in their conceptualization and implementation, and may cause miscommunication for both researchers and practitioners. We employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to systematically extract and analyze definitions of DTs from a corpus of more than 15,000 full-text articles spanning diverse disciplines. The study compares these findings with insights from an expert survey that included 52 experts. The study identifies concurrence on the components that comprise a “Digital Twin” from a practical perspective across various domains, contrasting them with those that do not, to identify deviations. We investigate the evolution of digital twin definitions over time and across different scales, including manufacturing, building, and urban/geospatial perspectives. We extracted the main components of Digital Twins using Text Frequency Analysis and N-gram analysis. Subsequently, we identified components that appeared in the literature and conducted a Chi-square test to assess the significance of each component in different domains. Our analysis identified key components of digital twins and revealed significant variations in definitions based on application domains, such as manufacturing, building, and urban contexts. The analysis of DT components reveal two major groups of DT types: High-Performance Real-Time (HPRT) DTs, and Long-Term Decision Support (LTDS) DTs. Contrary to common assumptions, we found that components such as simulation, AI/ML, real-time capabilities, and bi-directional data flow are not yet fully mature in the digital twins of the built environment. We derived two definitions for the Building/Architecture DT and the City/Urban DTs. Both definitions have a must-have components (such as spatial and temporal data updates) and good-to-have components such as prediction, AI, bi-directional data flow, and Real-time data exchange. One of the key findings is that the definition of digital twins has not yet reached its equilibrium phase, highlighting the need for ongoing revisions as technologies emerge or existing ones become obsolete. To address this, we introduce a novel, reproducible methodology that enables researchers to refine and adapt the current definitions in response to technological advancements or deprecations.",

         "Point-of-interest (POI) extraction aims to extract text POIs from real-world data. Existing POI methods, such as social media-based user generating and web crawling, either require massive human resources or cannot guarantee integrity and reliability. Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end POI extraction framework based on digital city is proposed. It is built of digital models, textures, tiles and other digital assets collected by aircraft. The extraction process for POIs consists of segmenting it into four sequential stages: collecting, segmentation, recognition and cleaning, each enhanced through fine-tuning on a proposed specialised digital scene dataset or via the development of tailored algorithms. Specifically, in the last stage, the application of large language model (LLM) is explored in the POI data cleaning field. By testing several LLMs of different scales using diverse chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies, the relatively optimal prompt scheme for different LLMs is identified regarding noise handling, formatted output and overall cleaning capability. Ultimately, POIs extracted through the proposed methodology exhibit superior quality and accuracy, surpassing the comprehensiveness of existing public commercial POI datasets, with the F1-score increased by 19.6%, 21.1% and 23.8% on Amap, Baidu and Google POI datasets, respectively.",

         "The attractiveness of urban environments significantly impacts residents' satisfaction with their living spaces and their overall mood, which in turn, affects their health and well-being. Given the resource-intensive nature of gathering evaluations on urban attractiveness through surveys or inquiries from residents, there is a constant quest for automated solutions to streamline this process and support spatial planning. In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban attractiveness, using over 1800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the GPT-4 model, we assessed these images through three criteria-based prompts. Simultaneously, 24 participants, categorised into residents and non-residents, were asked to rate the images. To gain insights into the non-transparent decision-making processes of GPT-4, we employed semantic segmentation to explore how the model uses different image features. Our results demonstrated a strong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic disparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban areas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these areas less attractive. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated urban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower attractiveness scores than participant ratings. The semantic segmentation analysis revealed that GPT-4's ratings were primarily influenced by physical features like vegetation, buildings, and sidewalk. While there was general agreement between AI and human assessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual nuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and features of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models like GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the attractiveness of different areas efficiently. However, caution is necessary, while we used an off-the-shelf model, it is crucial to develop models specifically trained to understand the local context. Although AI models provide valuable insights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of urban attractiveness.",

         "Achieving super-resolution with satellite images is a critical task for enhancing the utility of remote sensing data across various applications, including urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. Traditional interpolation methods often fail to recover fine details, while deep-learning-based approaches, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have significantly advanced super-resolution performance. Recent studies have explored large-scale models, such as Transformer-based architectures and diffusion models, demonstrating improved texture realism and generalization across diverse datasets. However, these methods frequently have high computational costs and require extensive datasets for training, making real-world deployment challenging. We propose the multi-branch generative prior integration network (MBGPIN) to address these limitations. This novel framework integrates multiscale feature extraction, hybrid attention mechanisms, and generative priors derived from pretrained VQGAN models. The dual-pathway architecture of the MBGPIN includes a feature extraction pathway for spatial features and a generative prior pathway for external guidance, dynamically fused using an adaptive generative prior fusion (AGPF) module. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as UC Merced, NWPU-RESISC45, and RSSCN7 demonstrate that the MBGPIN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including large-scale super-resolution models. The MBGPIN delivers a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) scores while preserving high-frequency details and complex textures.

Unlike conventional methods that focus on either spectral imagery or digital surface models (DSMs), the proposed method combines RGB color imagery, DSMs, and building vector maps in a three-branch Siamese architecture to enhance spatial, spectral, and elevation-based feature extraction. We chose Hsinchu, Taiwan as the experimental site and used 1:1000 digital topographic maps and airborne imagery from 2017, 2020, and 2023. The experimental results demonstrated that the data fusion model significantly outperforms other data combinations, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in detecting building changes. The RGB images provide spectral and texture details, DSMs offer structural and elevation context, and the building vector map enhances semantic consistency. This research advances building change detection by introducing a fully transformer-based model for end-to-end change detection, incorporating diverse geospatial data sources, and improving accuracy over traditional CNN-based methods.

         "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks.

         "Intersections are frequently identified as crash hotspots for roadways in major cities, leading to significant human casualties. We propose crash likelihood prediction as an effective strategy to proactively prevent intersection crashes. So far, no reliable models have been developed for intersections that effectively account for the variation in crash types and the cyclical nature of Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) and traffic flow. Moreover, the limited research available has primarily relied on sampling techniques to address data imbalance, without exploring alternative solutions. We develop an anomaly detection framework by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to predict the likelihood of cycle-level crashes at intersections. The model is built using high-resolution event data extracted from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM), including SPaT and traffic flow insights from 11 intersections in Seminole County, Florida. Our framework demonstrates a sensitivity of 76% in predicting crash events using highly imbalanced crash data along with real-world SPaT and traffic data, highlighting its potential for deployment at smart intersections. Overall, the results provide a roadmap for city-wide implementation at smart intersections, with the potential for multiple real-time solutions for impending crashes. These include adjustments in signal timing, driver warnings using various means, and more efficient emergency response, all with major implications for creating more livable and safe cities.",

However, this widespread adaptation of the Internet of Things networks has been vulnerable to several attacks. Lack of security protocols, unauthorized access, and improper device updates lead the Internet of Things environment to several attacks, which impact network security and confidentiality of users. This paper develops an innovative approach that integrates Edge Implicit Weighting and Aggregated Graph Transformer architecture for accurate and timely intrusion detection. The proposed technique aggregates information from both one-hop and two-hop neighbors to derive immediate and extended relational context thereby improving the detection of complex attacks. This approach designs an Edge Implicit Weighting mechanism that allows the model to prioritize structurally significant relationships and enhance the accuracy of attack detection. The multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the detection of relevant patterns even in highly variable traffic scenarios. Further, the proposed framework incorporates the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique to generate synthetic samples of minority classes to reduce class imbalance problems and attain balanced detection performance across all classes. The performance of the proposed detection technique is analyzed using multiple datasets with standard evaluation parameters. The proposed technique achieves outstanding performance results including an accuracy of 98.87% and a recall of 98.36%. From this experimental validation, it's clear that the proposed framework provides robust performance under diverse network conditions and handles imbalanced data effectively.",

In this paper, we present a technique for training 2D neural networks to repeatedly sculpt a plane into a large-scale 3D urban environment. An initial coarse depth map is created by a GAN model, from which we refine 3D normal and depth using an image translation network regularized by a linear system.

         "The intelligent design of shear wall structures is a critical aspect of smart construction, with a high demand for research and applications. Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs.",

         "Given historical traffic distributions and associated urban conditions observed in a city, the conditional urban traffic estimation problem aims at estimating realistic future projections of the traffic under a set of new urban conditions, e.g., new bus routes, rainfall intensity, and travel demands. The problem is important in reducing traffic congestion, improving public transportation efficiency, and facilitating urban planning. However, solving this problem is challenging due to the strong spatial dependencies of traffic patterns and the complex relations between the traffic and urban conditions. Recently, we proposed a Complex-Condition-Controlled Generative Adversarial Network (C3-GAN), which tackles both of the challenges and solves the urban traffic estimation problem under various complex conditions by adding a fixed embedding network and an inference network on top of the standard conditional GAN model. The randomly chosen embedding network transforms the complex conditions to latent vectors, and the inference network enhances the connections between the embedded vectors and the traffic data. However, a randomly chosen embedding network cannot always successfully extract features of complex urban conditions, which indicates C3-GAN is unable to uniquely map different urban conditions to proper latent distributions. Thus, C3-GAN would fail in certain traffic estimation tasks. Besides, C3-GAN is hard to train due to vanishing gradients and mode collapse problems. To address these issues, in this article, we extend our prior work by introducing a new deep generative model, namely, C3-GAN+, which significantly improves the estimation performance and model stability. C3-GAN+ has new objective, architecture, and training algorithm. The new objective applies Wasserstein loss to the conditional generation case to encourage stable training. Shared convolutional layers between the discriminator and the inference network help to capture spatial dependencies of traffic more efficiently, part of the shared convolutional layers are used to update the embedding network periodically aiming to encourage good representation and avoid model divergence. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our C3-GAN+ produces high-quality traffic estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Contrary to the assumption that data balancing improves classification performance, the analysis reveals a more complex impact. Using three publicly available network traffic benchmark datasets and four different balancing techniques, the study evaluates the performance of five classifiers on 65 classification tasks. The findings indicate that, for smaller datasets, classifiers that achieved the highest accuracy on unbalanced data did not benefit from synthetic data generation for minority classes. Although neural network-based classifiers showed improved performance with balanced data, these improvements came at the cost of lower overall classification scores. For larger datasets, balancing through random oversampling of minority classes and undersampling of majority classes helped improve classification. However, these improvements were limited to precision, with no significant gains in recall. The study offers valuable insights into using synthetic data for intrusion detection, emphasizing the challenges of intricate dependencies in network traffic data for generative models. The results align with previous research showing mixed effects of data balancing on classifier performance, contributing to a broader understanding of the limited efficacy of synthetic data in real-world network contexts.

The I-UDT enables more accurate and comprehensive urban energy management, supporting the development of sustainable cities and carbon-neutral strategies. Implementing I-UDTs enables urban policymakers to make data-driven decisions, improve energy efficiency, and enhance the scalability of digital twin applications. The concept of digital twins (DTs) has expanded to encompass buildings and cities, with urban building energy modeling (UBEM) playing a crucial role in predicting urban-scale energy consumption via modeling individual energy use and interactions. As a virtual model within urban digital twins (UDTs), UBEM offers the potential for managing energy in sustainable cities. However, UDTs face challenges with regard to integrating large-scale data and relying on bottom-up UBEM approaches. In this study, we propose an AI agent-based intelligent urban digital twin (I-UDT) to enhance DTs’ technical realization and UBEM’s service functionality. Integrating GPT within the UDT enabled the efficient integration of fragmented city-scale data and the extraction of building features, addressing the limitations of the service realization of traditional UBEM. This framework ensures continuous updates of the virtual urban model and the streamlined provision of updated information to users in future studies. This research establishes the concept of an I-UDT and lays a foundation for future implementations. The case studies include (1) data analysis, (2) prediction, (3) feature engineering, and (4) information services for 3500 buildings in Seoul.

This framework ensures continuous updates of the virtual urban model and the streamlined provision of updated information to users in future studies. This research establishes the concept of an I-UDT and lays a foundation for future implementations. The case studies include (1) data analysis, (2) prediction, (3) feature engineering, and (4) information services for 3500 buildings in Seoul. Through these case studies, the I-UDT was integrated and analyzed scattered data, predicted energy consumption, derived conditioned areas, and evaluated buildings on benchmark.",

         "Highlights: What are the main findings? For smart city management, LLM-based multi-agent systems achieve 94–99% accuracy in routing urban queries and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLMs (0.30–0.38). Achievement of high scores in routing queries and response accuracy is possible with middle-size LLM models rather than the biggest LLM models. What is the implication of the main findings? The multi-agent LLM approach enables efficient processing of complex urban planning tasks while maintaining high relevance in responses, making it practical for real-world city management applications. LLM agents can effectively augment human decision making in urban planning by reducing task completion time from days to hours while maintaining accuracy and accountability in complex scenarios. This study investigates the implementation of LLM agents in smart city management, leveraging both the inherent language processing abilities of LLMs and the distributed problem solving capabilities of multi-agent systems for the improvement of urban decision making processes. A multi-agent system architecture combines LLMs with existing urban information systems to process complex queries and generate contextually relevant responses for urban planning and management. The research is focused on three main hypotheses testing: (1) LLM agents’ capability for effective routing and processing diverse urban queries, (2) the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology in improving response accuracy when working with local knowledge and regulations, and (3) the impact of integrating LLM agents with existing urban information systems. Our experimental results, based on a comprehensive validation dataset of 150 question–answer pairs, demonstrate significant improvements in decision support capabilities. The multi-agent system achieved pipeline selection accuracy of 94–99% across different models, while the integration of RAG technology improved response accuracy by 17% for strategic development queries and 55% for service accessibility questions. The combined use of document databases and service APIs resulted in the highest performance metrics (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLM responses (0.30–0.38). Using St. Petersburg’s Digital Urban Platform as a testbed, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach to create integrated city management systems with support complex urban decision making processes. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced urban management by providing empirical evidence of LLM agents’ effectiveness in processing heterogeneous urban data and supporting strategic planning decisions.

         "The use of synthetic populations has grown considerably over the recent years, in revolutionizing studies conducted within various fields, including social science research, urban planning, public health and transportation modeling. These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners. This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals. In conclusion, despite a number of limitations, VAE constitutes a very promising methodology for generating synthetic populations, in offering practitioners numerous advantages. This paper is accompanied by a Python notebook to assist interested readers implement this new methodology.",

         "The use of synthetic populations has grown considerably over the recent years, in revolutionizing studies conducted within various fields, including social science research, urban planning, public health and transportation modeling. These synthetic populations prove to be valuable, as substitutes for the often missing or sensitive real data, and moreover are capable of preserving both privacy and representativeness. They are typically constructed from aggregate and/or sample data. Recently, new methods for generating synthetic populations based on deep learning, notably Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been developed. Such methods serve to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), which are unable to generate agents with cross-modalities not found in the sample data. As such, IPF requires large samples to generate a synthetic population closely resembling the actual one. Conversely, the advantage of VAE lies in their ability to generate agents not found in the sample data, albeit with the risk of creating agents not existing in the actual population. However, the practical documentation as well as detailed analyses of the architectures and results from implementation of these deep learning approaches, in particular VAE, are limited, thus making these methods difficult to appropriate for practitioners.",
         "This paper focuses on generating synthetic populations using VAE. First, an in-depth and accessible theoretical explanation of how VAEs function is provided. Next, a detailed study of these methods is carried out by testing the various architectures, parameters, sample sizes and evaluation indicators necessary to guarantee high-quality results. Highlighted herein is the ability of VAEs to generate large datasets with a small training sample, in addition to VAE performance in generating new realistic individuals not present in the learning base. Certain limitations are identified, including the difficulties encountered by VAEs in managing numerical attributes and the need for post-processing to eliminate unrealistic individuals. In conclusion, despite a number of limitations, VAE constitutes a very promising methodology for generating synthetic populations, in offering practitioners numerous advantages. This paper is accompanied by a Python notebook to assist interested readers implement this new methodology.",

         "With the trends of technology convergence and technology interdisciplinarity, technology-field (TF) resolution and classification of patents have gradually been challenged. Whether for patent applicants or for patent examiners, more precisely labeling the TF for a certain patent is important for technological searches. However, determining the TF of a patent may be difficult and may even involve the strategic behavior of patenting, which can cause noise in patent classification systems (PCSs). In addition, some specific patents could contain more TFs than claimed or be assigned questionable IPC codes; subsequently, in a regular search for technology/patents, information could be missed. Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-LSTM, BERT and GPT-4 etc. Therefore, the proposed MLR model with a customized loss function could be moderately effective for patent classification within a specific technology theme, could have implications for patent classification and the TF resolution of patents, and could further enrich methodologies for patent mining and informetrics based on artificial intelligence (AI).",

This approach enables the rapid assessment of urban traffic noise distribution by using urban elements such as roads and buildings as the input.

However, this expansion has been paralleled by a corresponding increase in the sophistication and variety of cyber threats targeting these networks. Traditional cyber security measures, designed for a less dynamic threat landscape, are proving increasingly insufficient in protecting against the innovative and varied attack methods now in commonplace. This study introduces an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address this challenge, presenting a novel framework for the simulation and mitigation of advanced network attacks, particularly focusing on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and spoofing attacks which pose significant threats in IoT environments. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), comprising two neural networks-the generator and the discriminator compete in a game-theoretic scenario, facilitating a deep understanding of attack patterns through the generation of realistic, synthetic cyber-attack scenarios. This research exploits GANs to bridge the gap between the static nature of traditional security protocols and the dynamic, evolving landscape of cyber threats. By training on a comprehensive dataset of known attacks and normal network activities, our proposed model, the Dynamic Adaptive Threat Simulation GAN (DATS-GAN), is capable of producing varied and realistic attack scenarios. These simulations serve a dual purpose: they not only enhance the detection capabilities and responsiveness of current security systems but also provide a basis for the development of new, adaptive security mechanisms capable of dynamically responding to the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. The effectiveness of DATS-GAN is demonstrated through extensive empirical analysis, highlighting significant improvements in the detection precision and reaction times of security frameworks within WSNs. Moreover, the generated synthetic attack scenarios provide a valuable resource for training machine learning models, leading to the advancement of adaptive security solutions that maintain a high readiness level against emerging cyber threats.

         "Various forms of degradation, including noise, blur, and adverse weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, and fog), significantly compromise video quality and system reliability across critical domains ranging from surveillance and medical imaging to entertainment. Previous research mainly focuses on network models tailored to specific degradation types, while recent unified frameworks and foundation models still face critical challenges in temporal consistency, automated degradation recognition, and detail preservation. Despite recent advances in foundation models, current approaches rely heavily on predefined degradation labels and remain focused on image-level operations, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios and struggling with preserving fine-grained details. To address these challenges, we propose Grid Splicing Diffusion Model (GSDiff), a general framework for video reconstruction that leverages a novel grid splicing execution alongside instruction-tuned Large Language Model (LLM). GSDiff introduces three key innovative modules: (1) a LLM-driven degradation recognition module that enables automatic and fine-grained restoration guidance through zero-shot degradation analysis, (2) a Grid Splicing Module that organizes multiple frames into a unified grid structure to facilitate spatiotemporal feature processing, and (3) a Detail Preservation Module integrated with a Tail Refine Network to enhance fine-grained details during diffusion and post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSDiff delivers state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including deraining, desnowing, denoising, and deblurring, propelling advancements in medical diagnostics and smart city applications.",

         "Analyzing and comprehending check-in sequences is crucial for various applications in smart cities. However, publicly available check-in datasets are often limited in scale due to privacy concerns. This poses a significant obstacle to academic research and downstream applications. Thus, it is urgent to generate realistic check-in datasets. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) as one of the most capable generation methods is a good choice to achieve this goal. However, generating check-in sequences using DDPM is not an easy feat. The difficulties lie in handling check-in sequences of variable lengths and capturing the correlation from check-in sequences’ distinct characteristics. This paper addresses the challenges by proposing a Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Diffusion Model (STCDM). This model introduces a novel spatio-temporal lossless encoding method that effectively encodes check-in sequences into a suitable format with equal length. Furthermore, we capture the spatio-temporal correlations with two disentangled diffusion modules to reduce the impact of the difference between spatial and temporal characteristics. Finally, we incorporate contrastive learning to enhance the relationship between diffusion modules. We generate four realistic datasets in different scenarios using STCDM and design four metrics for comparison. Experiments demonstrate that our generated datasets are more realistic and free of privacy leakage.",

         "Fire detection has held stringent importance in computer vision for over half a century. The development of early fire detection strategies is pivotal to the realization of safe and smart cities, inhabitable in the future. However, the development of optimal fire and smoke detection models is hindered by limitations like publicly available datasets, lack of diversity, and class imbalance. In this work, we explore the possible ways forward to overcome these challenges posed by available datasets. We study the impact of a class-balanced dataset to improve the fire detection capability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision-based models and propose the use of generative models for data augmentation, as a future work direction. First, a comparative analysis of two prominent object detection architectures, You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) and YOLOv8 has been carried out using a balanced dataset, where both models have been evaluated across various evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP). The results are compared to other recent fire detection models, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed YOLOv8 architecture as trained on our balanced dataset. Next, a fractal dimension analysis gives a deeper insight into the repetition of patterns in fire, and the effectiveness of the results has been demonstrated by a windowing-based inference approach. The proposed Slicing-Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) improves the fire and smoke detection capability of YOLOv8 for real-life applications with a significantly improved mAP performance over a strict confidence threshold. YOLOv8 with SAHI inference gives a mAP:50-95 improvement of more than 25% compared to the base YOLOv8 model. The study also provides insights into future work direction by exploring the potential of generative models like deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and diffusion models like stable diffusion, for data augmentation.",

         "Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) presents unique challenges and plays a critical role in applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce richly descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. However, most current RSIC models generally apply only fine-tuning to these datasets without developing models tailored to the unique characteristics of remote sensing imagery. This paper proposes RS-MoE, the first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) task.",

         "In recent years, the rapid urbanization and development of the social economy have led to a growing focus on public safety issues. Governments across the world are increasingly promoting the construction of smart cities and intelligent security systems to safeguard the lives and property of citizens and maintain social stability. Person re-identification (ReID) is an essential technology for building smart cities, with significant implications for security monitoring and criminal investigation applications. The goal of person re-identification is to accurately identify specific individuals captured under different cameras. However, due to intra-class differences resulting from various factors such as illumination, viewpoint, occlusion, and pose, person re-identification remains a challenging task in the field of computer vision. Although existing fully supervised person re-identification methods have made significant progress, the scarcity of data and labels poses a bottleneck for further improving model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce a more complex and diverse synthetic dataset with easy-to-obtain labels for auxiliary training, and propose a novel camera-aware asymmetric adversarial learning (CAAL) method that overcomes intra-class variation among multiple cameras and the domain-shift between real data and synthetic data, enabling the learning of camera-invariant feature representations from diverse data sources. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of misleading information carried by synthetic datasets and prevent the model from overfitting to synthetic data during adversarial training, we propose using an auxiliary network trained on real-world data to constrain the training of the backbone network. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

         "One of the challenges of the Internet of Things and smart cities is energy consumption and energy theft. An accurate approach to predicting energy consumption and detecting energy theft in smart cities increases efficiency and energy efficiency. Forecasting energy consumption makes energy production based on the needs of consumers, and detecting energy theft makes energy consumption forecasting models more accurate. In this manuscript, in the first step, the data set is balanced using the generative adversarial network based on game theory and the synthetic minority oversampling based on sample density method. In the second step, the basic features of the samples are selected with the Namib beetle optimization (NBO) algorithm to reduce the input of the CNN-LSTM model. In the third step, the hyperparameters of the CNN-LSTM model are optimized to reduce the prediction and classification error rate with the NBO algorithm. In the Benin Electricity Company dataset, the proposed method has fewer errors in predicting energy consumption than the LSTM, GRU, ARIMA-LSTM, and ARIMA-GRU methods. On the Individual Household Electric-Power Consumption dataset, the proposed method provides lower energy consumption prediction errors than convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and CNN-LSTM. The NBO algorithm optimizer CNN-LSTM hyperparameters more accurately than Coati optimization algorithm, jellyfish search optimization, Harris hawks optimization (HHO), and African vultures optimization algorithm. Experiments on the State Grid Corporation of China dataset showed that the proposed method's accuracy, sensitivity, and precision in predicting energy theft are 98.93, 98.32, and 96.78%.

         "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled researchers to develop tools to monitor real-world events and user behavior using social media platforms. Twitter is particularly useful for gathering invaluable information related to diseases and public health to build real-time disease surveillance systems. Such systems offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the passive, expensive, and time-consuming process of using data from healthcare organizations and hospitals. In this paper, we propose a novel system of TepiSense to automatically perform disease surveillance of epidemic-prone diseases. Our system classifies tweets related to diseases and further identifies 'indication' tweets that highlight the presence of patients. Our system consists of four distinct modules of pre-processor, feature extractor, classifier, and evaluator. TepiSense compares the performance of 3 feature extraction techniques, 9 machine/deep learning models, and 3 Large Language Models (LLMs). To test the performance of our system, we build a dataset of Twitter Epidemic Surveillance Corpus (TESC) containing 23.9K English and 13K labelled Urdu tweets related to six diseases: COVID19, hepatitis, malaria, flu, dengue, and HIV/AIDS. Our results show that mBERT LLM achieves the highest F-measure values of 0.96 and 0.83 for topic and indication tweets classification, respectively. Furthermore, we compute the correlation of signals generated by our system with real-world cases to test the efficacy on COVID19 disease. We notice that real-world cases have a correlation of 0.58-0.63 with the indication category tweets. Finally, we develop an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to disseminate the analytics of our system. Overall, our system offers a powerful tool for real-time disease surveillance using social media with potential implications for public health policy and decision-making.",

In this paper, we quantitatively assess the diffusion characteristics of ‘pure’ 4G mobile communication in India using popular nonlinear diffusion models, and scrutinize the association of two external factors, namely Human Development and Urbanization, with formal and informal communication channels of diffusion, in the context of 4G. Our findings highlight the crucial role external factors play in the speed and pattern of 4G diffusion across India. Notably, the 4G diffusion is predominantly driven by informal communication channels, such as word of mouth and interpersonal signalling. Typically, in regions with lower levels of Human Development and Urbanization, the informal communication channels have a greater influence on the diffusion. However, as the levels of Human Development and Urbanization go up, the formal communication channels start gathering momentum. Thus, our preliminary study sheds light on how Human Development and Urbanization interact with formal and informal communication channels to shape the diffusion of 4G in emerging economies. Our findings could furnish valuable perspectives for policymakers and stakeholders toward refining their strategies concerning infrastructure deployment, socio-economic development, and regulatory interventions.",

Therefore, this paper presents a 3D self-awareness diffusion network (3DSA-DiffNet) for multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) image fusion classification, which would make it easier to classify heterogeneous data from various sensors. First, in order to model the relationship between multi-channel spectra and multi-pixel spatial distributions as well as samples, respectively, a spatial-spectral joint denoising network (S2 JD-Net) is proposed.
