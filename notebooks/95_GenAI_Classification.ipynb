Automatic building detection and extraction algorithms using high spatial resolution aerial images can provide precise location and geometry information, significantly reducing time, costs, and labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer, have robust local or global feature extraction ability, achieving advanced performance in intelligent interpretation compared with conventional methods. However, buildings often exhibit scale variation, spectral heterogeneity, and similarity with complex geometric shapes. Hence, the building rooftop extraction results exist fragmentation and lack spatial details using these methods. To address these issues, this study developed a multi-scale global perceptron network based on Transformer and CNN using novel encoder-decoders for enhancing contextual representation of buildings. Specifically, an improved multi-head-attention encoder is employed by constructing multi-scale tokens to enhance global semantic correlations. Meanwhile, the context refinement decoder is developed and synergistically uses high-level semantic representation and shallow features to restore spatial details. Overall, quantitative analysis and visual experiments confirmed that the proposed model is more efficient and superior to other state-of-the-art methods, with a 95.18% F1 score on the WHU dataset and a 93.29% F1 score on the Massub dataset.",

Purpose: This paper proposes a solution to address matching challenges, such as incomplete descriptions, reversed word order, and the diverse descriptions often found in Chinese addresses. Method: Leveraging the hierarchical structure of Chinese addresses, this study introduces the interactive address matching graph attention model (IAMGAM). In the IAMGAM, an attention-based feature interaction method (AFIM) is employed. To reflect the hierarchical nature of address elements, a directed graph is used to model the address data, and the model is trained and tested using a graph attention mechanism. Results: Experiments demonstrate that the IAMGAM achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 99.61%. Compared with the existing address matching methods, the IAMGAM improves the accuracy by 0.66% to 2.57%, and the F1-score by 0.68% to 2.55%, outperforming baseline models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component within the model. Furthermore, when fine-tuned using ChatGLM2-6B, the results show that the IAMGAM still outperforms ChatGLM2-6B. Conclusion: IAMGAM demonstrates excellent performance in Chinese address matching tasks, and the Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods, such as ChatGLM2-6B, show great potential for future development in this area.",

Although Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant interest and achieved decent performance in various scenarios, most existing FL-based distributed anomaly detection methods still face challenges including: inadequate detection performance in global model, insufficient essential features extraction caused by the fragmentation of local time series, and lack for practical anomaly localization. To address these challenges, we propose an Unsupervised Federated Hypernetwork Method for Distributed Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis (uFedHy-DisMTSADD). Specifically, we introduce a federated hypernetwork architecture that effectively mitigates the heterogeneity and fluctuations in distributed environments while protecting client data privacy. Then, we adopt the Series Conversion Normalization Transformer (SC Nor-Transformer) to tackle the timing bias due to model aggregation through series conversion. Series normalization improves the temporal dependence of capturing subsequences. Finally, uFedHy-DisMTSADD simultaneously localizes the root cause of the anomaly by reconstructing the anomaly scores obtained from each subsequence. We performed an extensive evaluation on nine datasets, in which uFedHy-DisMTSADD outperformed the existing state-of-the-art baseline average F1 score by 9.19% and the average AUROC by 2.41%. Moreover, the average localization fault accuracy of uFedHy-DisMTSADD is 9.23% higher than that of the optimal baseline method.

         "Building rooftop extraction has been applied in various fields, such as cartography, urban planning, automatic driving, and intelligent city construction. Automatic building detection and extraction algorithms using high spatial resolution aerial images can provide precise location and geometry information, significantly reducing time, costs, and labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer, have robust local or global feature extraction ability, achieving advanced performance in intelligent interpretation compared with conventional methods. However, buildings often exhibit scale variation, spectral heterogeneity, and similarity with complex geometric shapes. Hence, the building rooftop extraction results exist fragmentation and lack spatial details using these methods. To address these issues, this study developed a multi-scale global perceptron network based on Transformer and CNN using novel encoder-decoders for enhancing contextual representation of buildings. Specifically, an improved multi-head-attention encoder is employed by constructing multi-scale tokens to enhance global semantic correlations. Meanwhile, the context refinement decoder is developed and synergistically uses high-level semantic representation and shallow features to restore spatial details. Overall, quantitative analysis and visual experiments confirmed that the proposed model is more efficient and superior to other state-of-the-art methods, with a 95.18% F1 score on the WHU dataset and a 93.29% F1 score on the Massub dataset.",

Purpose: This paper proposes a solution to address matching challenges, such as incomplete descriptions, reversed word order, and the diverse descriptions often found in Chinese addresses. Method: Leveraging the hierarchical structure of Chinese addresses, this study introduces the interactive address matching graph attention model (IAMGAM). In the IAMGAM, an attention-based feature interaction method (AFIM) is employed. To reflect the hierarchical nature of address elements, a directed graph is used to model the address data, and the model is trained and tested using a graph attention mechanism. Results: Experiments demonstrate that the IAMGAM achieves an accuracy and F1-score of 99.61%. Compared with the existing address matching methods, the IAMGAM improves the accuracy by 0.66% to 2.57%, and the F1-score by 0.68% to 2.55%, outperforming baseline models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each component within the model. Furthermore, when fine-tuned using ChatGLM2-6B, the results show that the IAMGAM still outperforms ChatGLM2-6B. Conclusion: IAMGAM demonstrates excellent performance in Chinese address matching tasks, and the Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods, such as ChatGLM2-6B, show great potential for future development in this area.",

Although Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant interest and achieved decent performance in various scenarios, most existing FL-based distributed anomaly detection methods still face challenges including: inadequate detection performance in global model, insufficient essential features extraction caused by the fragmentation of local time series, and lack for practical anomaly localization. To address these challenges, we propose an Unsupervised Federated Hypernetwork Method for Distributed Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis (uFedHy-DisMTSADD). Specifically, we introduce a federated hypernetwork architecture that effectively mitigates the heterogeneity and fluctuations in distributed environments while protecting client data privacy. Then, we adopt the Series Conversion Normalization Transformer (SC Nor-Transformer) to tackle the timing bias due to model aggregation through series conversion. Series normalization improves the temporal dependence of capturing subsequences. Finally, uFedHy-DisMTSADD simultaneously localizes the root cause of the anomaly by reconstructing the anomaly scores obtained from each subsequence. We performed an extensive evaluation on nine datasets, in which uFedHy-DisMTSADD outperformed the existing state-of-the-art baseline average F1 score by 9.19% and the average AUROC by 2.41%. Moreover, the average localization fault accuracy of uFedHy-DisMTSADD is 9.23% higher than that of the optimal baseline method.

This research introduces a novel two-stage stochastic approach for distribution network expansion planning in smart grids with high renewable energy penetration, addressing uncertainty, risk, and distributed generators' remuneration. Key contributions include: the incorporation of third-party generation owners' economic remuneration into a risk-based stochastic model; the use of conditional value-at-risk to manage uncertainty and extreme events, with a detailed analysis of cost evolution for various confidence levels and risk aversion parameters; the optimization of energy storage systems sizing and placement, alongside the location and type of new power lines and substation transformers, ensuring a reliable and radial network topology; and the integration of multiple factors, including uncertainty, risk aversion, ESS allocation, remuneration, and reliability, into a unified model that ensures optimal network design under technical constraints. Tested on a 180-bus network in Leiria, Portugal and on a 13-bus smart city mockup from Salamanca, Spain, the approach proved economically viable, reducing extreme scenario costs by up to 34 % through CVaR-based risk management, and demonstrating its potential for sustainable, risk-averse network expansion.",

Tested on a 180-bus network in Leiria, Portugal and on a 13-bus smart city mockup from Salamanca, Spain, the approach proved economically viable, reducing extreme scenario costs by up to 34 % through CVaR-based risk management, and demonstrating its potential for sustainable, risk-averse network expansion.",
         "The integration of renewable energy into power networks introduces challenges due to intermittency and unpredictability, making precise expansion planning essential.",

Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end POI extraction framework based on digital city is proposed. It is built of digital models, textures, tiles and other digital assets collected by aircraft. The extraction process for POIs consists of segmenting it into four sequential stages: collecting, segmentation, recognition and cleaning, each enhanced through fine-tuning on a proposed specialised digital scene dataset or via the development of tailored algorithms. Specifically, in the last stage, the application of large language model (LLM) is explored in the POI data cleaning field. By testing several LLMs of different scales using diverse chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies, the relatively optimal prompt scheme for different LLMs is identified regarding noise handling, formatted output and overall cleaning capability. Ultimately, POIs extracted through the proposed methodology exhibit superior quality and accuracy, surpassing the comprehensiveness of existing public commercial POI datasets, with the F1-score increased by 19.6%, 21.1% and 23.8% on Amap, Baidu and Google POI datasets, respectively.",

Precise traffic flow prediction faces significant challenges due to spatial heterogeneity, dynamic correlations, and uncertainty. Most existing methods typically learn from a single spatial or temporal perspective, or at best combine the two in a limited dual-perspective manner, which limits their ability to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Fusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MSTDFGRN) to address these limitations. The core idea is to learn dynamic spatial dependencies alongside both short- and long-term temporal patterns through multi-view learning. First, we introduce a multi-view spatial convolution module that dynamically fuses static and adaptive graphs in multiple subspaces to learn intrinsic and potential spatial dependencies of nodes. Simultaneously, in the temporal view, we design both short-range and long-range recurrent networks to aggregate spatial domain knowledge of nodes at multiple granularities and capture forward and backward temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we design a spatio-temporal attention model that applies an attention mechanism to each node, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments on four real traffic flow datasets demonstrate MSTDFGRN's excellent predictive accuracy. Specifically, compared to the Spatial–Temporal Graph Attention Gated Recurrent Transformer Network model, our method improves the MAE by 4.69% on the PeMS08 dataset.",

         "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

         "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption.",

We propose crash likelihood prediction as an effective strategy to proactively prevent intersection crashes. So far, no reliable models have been developed for intersections that effectively account for the variation in crash types and the cyclical nature of Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) and traffic flow. Moreover, the limited research available has primarily relied on sampling techniques to address data imbalance, without exploring alternative solutions. We develop an anomaly detection framework by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers to predict the likelihood of cycle-level crashes at intersections. The model is built using high-resolution event data extracted from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM), including SPaT and traffic flow insights from 11 intersections in Seminole County, Florida. Our framework demonstrates a sensitivity of 76% in predicting crash events using highly imbalanced crash data along with real-world SPaT and traffic data, highlighting its potential for deployment at smart intersections. Overall, the results provide a roadmap for city-wide implementation at smart intersections, with the potential for multiple real-time solutions for impending crashes. These include adjustments in signal timing, driver warnings using various means, and more efficient emergency response, all with major implications for creating more livable and safe cities.",

         "The intelligent design of shear wall structures is a critical aspect of smart construction, with a high demand for research and applications. Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs.",

         "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart cities (SCs) rely on free-flow services streamlined by artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms. However, the nature of resource constraint prevails due to external infrastructure costs and energy-based allocations. Existing approaches to smart city resource distribution rely on static thresholds or reactive responses, which are not always sufficient. These approaches may limit system performance and scalability in dynamic IoT environments owing to increased energy consumption, postponed resource allocation, and frequent device failures. This article introduces a Concerted Resource Management (CRM) using the Leveled Reinforcement Training (LRT) method. The proposed method accurately identifies cost-complex and high energy-consuming sharing intervals based on service response time and device failure. The reinforcement learning and training concerts both energy and device incorporations for SC applications based on its demand. This process requires leveled training in resource management, from energy depletion to device activeness. The interrupted sessions are identified using resource allocation failures, and the active resources with optimal energy expenses are selected to pursue resource management. The training method thus identifies the demands based on independent or concerted resource allocations to mitigate the management constraints in an SC environment. This proposed method reduces the resource constraint-based waiting for allocations and allocation failures in any SC application services. Under the varying devices, the following is observed: Improvements: 9.1% (Allocation Rate), 10% (Device Detection), 11.88% (Constraint Mitigation— Energy), 9.06% (Constraint Mitigation—Resource Allocation); Reduced: 8.01% (Allocation Failure), 9.64% (Waiting Time).",

For smart city management, LLM-based multi-agent systems achieve 94–99% accuracy in routing urban queries and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLMs (0.30–0.38). Achievement of high scores in routing queries and response accuracy is possible with middle-size LLM models rather than the biggest LLM models. What is the implication of the main findings? The multi-agent LLM approach enables efficient processing of complex urban planning tasks while maintaining high relevance in responses, making it practical for real-world city management applications. LLM agents can effectively augment human decision making in urban planning by reducing task completion time from days to hours while maintaining accuracy and accountability in complex scenarios. This study investigates the implementation of LLM agents in smart city management, leveraging both the inherent language processing abilities of LLMs and the distributed problem solving capabilities of multi-agent systems for the improvement of urban decision making processes. A multi-agent system architecture combines LLMs with existing urban information systems to process complex queries and generate contextually relevant responses for urban planning and management. The research is focused on three main hypotheses testing: (1) LLM agents’ capability for effective routing and processing diverse urban queries, (2) the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology in improving response accuracy when working with local knowledge and regulations, and (3) the impact of integrating LLM agents with existing urban information systems. Our experimental results, based on a comprehensive validation dataset of 150 question–answer pairs, demonstrate significant improvements in decision support capabilities. The multi-agent system achieved pipeline selection accuracy of 94–99% across different models, while the integration of RAG technology improved response accuracy by 17% for strategic development queries and 55% for service accessibility questions. The combined use of document databases and service APIs resulted in the highest performance metrics (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLM responses (0.30–0.38). Using St. Petersburg’s Digital Urban Platform as a testbed, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach to create integrated city management systems with support complex urban decision making processes. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced urban management by providing empirical evidence of LLM agents’ effectiveness in processing heterogeneous urban data and supporting strategic planning decisions. Our findings suggest that LLM-based multi-agent systems can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of urban decision making while maintaining high relevance in responses.",

The developed AI framework is effective when grounded on five core technical capabilities with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automated agentic AI that feeds into human-in-the-loop processes. The framework provides a prototypical setting for university cities of the future to provide direction, guidance, and standards for sustainable and safe smart cities of the future. Smart cities are Hyper-Connected Digital Environments (HCDEs) that transcend the boundaries of natural, human-made, social, virtual, and artificial environments. Human activities are no longer confined to a single environment as our presence and interactions are represented and interconnected across HCDEs. The data streams and repositories of HCDEs provide opportunities for the responsible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that generates unique insights into the constituent environments and the interplay across constituents. The translation of data into insights poses several complex challenges originating in data generation and then propagating through the computational layers to decision outcomes. To address these challenges, this article presents the design and development of a Hyper-Automated AI framework with Generative AI agents for sustainable smart cities.

Whether for patent applicants or for patent examiners, more precisely labeling the TF for a certain patent is important for technological searches. However, determining the TF of a patent may be difficult and may even involve the strategic behavior of patenting, which can cause noise in patent classification systems (PCSs). In addition, some specific patents could contain more TFs than claimed or be assigned questionable IPC codes; subsequently, in a regular search for technology/patents, information could be missed. Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-LSTM, BERT and GPT-4 etc. Therefore, the proposed MLR model with a customized loss function could be moderately effective for patent classification within a specific technology theme, could have implications for patent classification and the TF resolution of patents, and could further enrich methodologies for patent mining and informetrics based on artificial intelligence (AI).",

         "Trajectory prediction of surrounding traffic participants is vital for the driving safety of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs). It has been enabled with the help of the availability of multi-sensor information collected by ICVs. For accurately predicting the future movements of traffic agents, it is crucial to subtlety model the inter-agent interaction. However, existing works focus on the correlations between agents and the map information while neglecting the importance of directly modeling the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions, the direct modeling of which is beneficial for the representation of agent behaviors. Against this background, we propose to model the hyper-relational interaction, which incorporates map elements into the inter-agent interaction. To tackle the hyper-relational interaction, we propose a novel Hyper-relational Multi-modal Trajectory Prediction (HyperMTP) approach. Specifically, a hyper-relational driving graph is first constructed and the hyper-relational interaction is represented as the hyperedge, directly connecting to various nodes (i.e., agents and map elements). Then a structure-aware embedding initialization technique is developed to obtain unbiased initial embeddings. Afterward, hypergraph dual-attention networks are designed to capture correlations between graph elements while retaining the hyper-relational structure. Finally, a heterogeneous Transformer is devised to further capture the correlations between agents’ states and their corresponding hyper-relational interactions. Experimental results show that HyperMTP consistently outperforms the best-performing baseline with an average improvement of 4.8% across two real-world datasets. Moreover, HyperMTP also boosts the interpretability of trajectory prediction by quantifying the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions.",

         "Against this background, we propose to model the hyper-relational interaction, which incorporates map elements into the inter-agent interaction. To tackle the hyper-relational interaction, we propose a novel Hyper-relational Multi-modal Trajectory Prediction (HyperMTP) approach. Specifically, a hyper-relational driving graph is first constructed and the hyper-relational interaction is represented as the hyperedge, directly connecting to various nodes (i.e., agents and map elements). Then a structure-aware embedding initialization technique is developed to obtain unbiased initial embeddings. Afterward, hypergraph dual-attention networks are designed to capture correlations between graph elements while retaining the hyper-relational structure. Finally, a heterogeneous Transformer is devised to further capture the correlations between agents’ states and their corresponding hyper-relational interactions. Experimental results show that HyperMTP consistently outperforms the best-performing baseline with an average improvement of 4.8% across two real-world datasets. Moreover, HyperMTP also boosts the interpretability of trajectory prediction by quantifying the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions.",
         "Trajectory prediction of surrounding traffic participants is vital for the driving safety of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs). It has been enabled with the help of the availability of multi-sensor information collected by ICVs. For accurately predicting the future movements of traffic agents, it is crucial to subtlety model the inter-agent interaction. However, existing works focus on the correlations between agents and the map information while neglecting the importance of directly modeling the impact of map elements on inter-agent interactions, the direct modeling of which is beneficial for the representation of agent behaviors.",

To overcome this difficulty, we introduce GRDATFusion, a novel end-to-end network comprising three key modules: transformer, gradient residual dense and attention residual. The gradient residual dense module extracts local complementary features, leveraging a dense-shaped network to retain potentially lost information. The attention residual module focuses on crucial input image details, while the transformer module captures global information and models long-range dependencies. Experiments on public datasets show that GRDATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in qualitative and quantitative assessments.

      "Contribution: This paper introduces NeuroSync, a novel neural network architecture designed to leverage the strengths of spiking neuron layers and gated recurrent units (GRUs) combined with temporal pattern attention mechanisms to effectively forecast traffic patterns. The architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities inherent in nonstationary urban traffic datasets, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships within the data. NeuroSync not only outperforms traditional forecasting models such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing but also shows significant improvement over contemporary neural network approaches like LSTM, CNN, Seq2Seq, RNN, GRU, Transformer, and Autoencoder in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The model's efficacy is demonstrated thr...\n",

      "Contribution: Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end POI extraction framework based on digital city is proposed. It is built of digital models, textures, tiles and other digital assets collected by aircraft. The extraction process for POIs consists of segmenting it into four sequential stages: collecting, segmentation, recognition and cleaning, each enhanced through fine-tuning on a proposed specialised digital scene dataset or via the development of tailored algorithms. Specifically, in the last stage, the application of large language model (LLM) is explored in the POI data cleaning field. By testing several LLMs of different scales using diverse chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies, the relatively optimal prompt scheme for different LLMs is identified regarding noise handling, formatted output and over...\n",

      "Contribution: Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-...\n",

The framework is empirically evaluated in the living lab setting of a ‘University City of the Future’. The developed AI framework is grounded on the core capabilities of acquisition, preparation, orchestration, dissemination, and retrospection, with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automation of these AI capabilities using Generative AI. Hyper-automation output feeds into a human-in-the-loop process prior to decision-making outcomes.

This approach designs an Edge Implicit Weighting mechanism that allows the model to prioritize structurally significant relationships and enhance the accuracy of attack detection. The multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the detection of relevant patterns even in highly variable traffic scenarios.
